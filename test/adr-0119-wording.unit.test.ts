/**
 * The statements of ADR 0119 that review of phase #2016 corrected or added, held where they are
 * said (the ADR, and its one-paragraph copy in the decisions index), so a later edit cannot put the
 * old claim back:
 *
 *   - a client that is not first-party NEVER SKIPS the consent screen and follows its consent mode;
 *     it is not one that "always shows" it;
 *   - first-party is its own rule (https on nemar.org, default port, no partner host, loopback and
 *     website previews only outside production), not the cross-origin one;
 *   - client secrets have a prefix, and signing keys have a revoked state;
 *   - the staging issuer is decided (each Worker's issuer is its own API_BASE_URL), so it is no
 *     longer in the not-decided list;
 *   - changing OIDC_SECRET after the first rotation is named as a consequence.
 *
 * Real files, no mocks.
