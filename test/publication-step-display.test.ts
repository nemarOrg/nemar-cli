/**
 * The CLI describes the publication it is about to run, not a different one
 * (#1447).
 *
 * The approve confirmation and `nemar dataset publish status` both rendered
 * `PUBLICATION_STEPS` unconditionally. An admin approving an ANONYMOUS RELEASE
 * was therefore shown a sixteen-step plan including "Make repo public" and
 * "Publish DOI (irreversible)", neither of which happens, and then watched the
 * progress stop at 12 of 16 on a release that had finished. Measured on the
 * dev worker while building nm099998: the banner listed all sixteen and the
 * orchestrator ran twelve, skipping the four in
 * `ANONYMOUS_RELEASE_SKIPPED_STEPS`.
 *
 * The live progress renderer was always right, because the backend hands it
 * the real step set. These two built their own.
