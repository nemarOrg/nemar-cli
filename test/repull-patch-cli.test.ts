/**
 * N.0.1: NEMAR's corrections replayed onto the released N.0.0 (ADR 0111, decisions 1 and 3; epic
 * #1046 phase 6, #1912), driven through the real entry point against `repull-pr-world.ts` with its
 * default fixture: NEMAR edited a sidecar and added a description key (two corrections) and edited
 * `participants.tsv`, which upstream changed too (a conflict). N.0.0 is merged by the real gate;
 * the test plays the dataset workflow (the tag) and the DOI's callback (the version row); every
 * step of the re-pull itself is the real CLI and the real Worker routes over bun:sqlite, on a
 * loopback port named in the child's environment. GitHub and S3 are stand-ins. No mocks.
 *
 * The properties, each with a test:
 *  - after the release and the lock, a plan with conflicts waits for an administrator's decision,
 *    and nothing is pushed;
 *  - with `--keep-upstream`, N.0.1 replays the sidecar byte for byte and the description key, says
 *    2.0.1, leaves the conflict on upstream's side, scrubs and copies nothing, and opens a second
 *    pull request; it then goes through the same screen, gates, merge (claiming the cap as N.0.1)
 *    and release as N.0.0, to `complete`, and `pr-reviews approve --merge` merges it through that
 *    same gate;
 *  - with `--take-ours participants.tsv`, the conflict is replayed as NEMAR had it;
 *  - a `--take-ours` that names no conflict refuses before anything is written;
 *  - abandon after the release declines N.0.1 (`patch_declined`), closing its pull request and
 *    deleting its branch when they exist, and never while N.0.0's lock is not recorded; a release
 *    branch or pull request of N.0.1's version that is not this re-pull's is neither closed nor
 *    deleted, a branch that cannot be judged is kept, a branch that moved after it was judged is
 *    not deleted (the delete is leased), and a merged N.0.1 pull request or a held claim refuses;
 *  - a plan file that is not the record's refuses (`plan-not-the-record`) and writes nothing;
 *  - a run that pushed N.0.1 and could not record it is taken up by the next run with the same
 *    resolutions, and refused (`branch-foreign`) with other ones;
 *  - N.0.1 is made on `main` as enrichment left it, not on the N.0.0 merge;
 *  - a `main` moved by enrichment with N.0.1's pull request `dirty` makes N.0.1 again, pushed with
 *    a lease, and a run that pushed it and could not record it is recognized by the next;
 *  - N.0.1's pull request closed without a merge ends the record `patch_declined`;
 *  - N.0.1's merge commit read back without its trailers stays `patch_merged` (`merge-trailers`);
 *    so does a tag whose tree is not N.0.1's gated head (`patch-tree-mismatch`), until resume is
 *    given the administrator's reason (`--accept-tag-tree`);
 *  - a record that does not state its corrections is not merged as N.0.1 (stage `message`).
 *
 * What only the canary and the first production runs can check: that GitHub opens and squash-merges
 * a second release pull request on the same repository as the stand-in does, and that the dataset
 * workflows tag v2.0.1 and mint its DOI as they do any other patch release.
 *
 * CI TIER: unit-pure. Hermetic: every server the suite starts or reaches listens on loopback.
