/**
 * Which backend the live test tier is allowed to talk to.
 *
 * This exists because the harness used to fail OPEN: `TEST_API_URL` unset meant
 * `https://api.nemar.org`, so a `bun test` in a fresh clone or worktree -- where
 * `test/.env.test` is gitignored and therefore absent -- pointed the whole live
 * tier at PRODUCTION without saying so. Six of the live suites had noticed and
 * grown their own `TEST_ALLOW_PROD` guard; the rest, including `test/cli.test.ts`
 * and `test/api.test.ts`, had not.
 *
 * What that cost, concretely: `test/cli.test.ts` runs `auth login -k <adminApiKey>`,
 * `adminApiKey` is `""` with no env file, and an empty `-k` used to fall through to
 * the browser device flow (fixed in `src/commands/auth.ts` in the same change) -- so
 * the suite minted a real device code on production and opened the developer's
 * browser on production's authorize page, which asks for an ORCID sign-in. A test
 * run initiating an account sign-in against production is the failure this file
 * closes, at the level where it can be closed once.
 *
 * The decision is a pure function because the enforcement in `test/setup.ts` runs
 * at import time, which is untestable by construction: by the time a test could
 * observe it, it has already happened.
