/**
 * A re-pull merged outside NEMAR's gate, with GitHub's own merge button, and its acceptance
 * (`nemar admin repull resume <id> --accept-merge-trailers "<reason>"`; epic #1046; ADR 0111, the
 * amendment of 2026-10-29; issue #1996), driven through the real entry point against
 * `repull-pr-world.ts` with a plan that has no corrections, so the record can reach `complete`.
 *
 * Everything NEMAR's is real: the CLI, the Worker's routes over bun:sqlite with every migration,
 * the real `git` and `git-annex` repositories served as bare origins, and the privacy ledger's own
 * fresh-clone rule (`ledgerChecks` in `scripts/scrub/git/git-lib.ts`) run on a fresh clone of the
 * origin the re-pull and the Worker wrote. GitHub is the suites' stand-in: its squash merge
 * commits onto the origin's `main` with the message it is sent, and its Git Data and Contents
 * answers are read from, and written to, the same origin. No mocks.
 *
 * The properties, each with a test that fails when its line is changed:
 *  - a merge without the trailers is refused at the release without the flag, and the dataset
 *    then fails the fresh-clone proof (`ledger-commit-not-alone`): the premise;
 *  - with a reason, the merge is verified, accepted, the ledger line naming it is written to
 *    `main` in a commit of its own, the release goes on to `complete`, and the proof passes;
 *  - a line that could not be written leaves the acceptance recorded, the Worker refuses the
 *    release until the line is on `main`, and the next run writes it once;
 *  - a parent, a head or a tree that is not the record's, a record the automatic path opened or
 *    another administrator's, and a merge commit that is not the record's are refused, by the CLI
 *    and by the Worker on its own, and nothing is written;
 *  - a head or a parent enrichment moved is accepted.
 *
 * What only production can check: that GitHub's Contents API takes the leased write of the ledger
 * on `main` and answers a stale `sha` with 409, and that GitHub's comparison names the files as
 * the stand-in does.
 *
 * CI TIER: unit-pure. Hermetic: every server the suite starts or reaches listens on loopback.
