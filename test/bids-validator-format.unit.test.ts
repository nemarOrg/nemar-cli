/**
 * Golden coverage for `shared/bytes.ts`'s `formatBytesTrimmed` (moved from
 * `src/lib/bids-validator.ts`'s module-private `formatBytes` in the epic
 * #1225 phase 4 consolidation, issue #1227).
 *
 * `formatBytesTrimmed` has no dedicated CLI entry point of its own, so per
 * .rules/testing.md ("test the entry point, not the piece") this drives it
 * through the real consumer, `formatValidationResult`, and reads the
 * "Size:" line of the rendered report exactly as `nemar dataset validate`
 * prints it.
 *
 * The expected strings below were computed independently against a verbatim
 * copy of the pre-consolidation formatter and cross-checked by running the
 * real function in this worktree before any implementation change landed --
 * see the phase 4 implementation brief on issue #1227 for the full
 * six-formatter table this is one column of.
 *
 * The 1 PiB case pins a real bug that this phase fixes (issue #1227 step
 * 3): the pre-consolidation formatter had no index clamp, so at 1 PiB and
 * above `sizes[i]` was `undefined` and the line read "Size: 1 undefined".
 * This is a golden expectation this phase's consolidation commit is allowed
 * to change (the sanctioned exception the implementation brief calls out)
 * -- it now pins the FIXED, clamped value. Every value below 1 PiB is
 * unaffected by the fix and unchanged from the first commit.
 *
 * The +Infinity bad-input case ALSO changes, as a side effect of the same
 * clamp, and was not called out by the brief -- discovered by running this
 * test after the fix landed. `Math.min(Infinity, maxIndex)` clamps to
 * `maxIndex` (unlike `Math.min(NaN, maxIndex)`, which stays `NaN`), so
 * +Infinity moves from "NaN undefined" to "Infinity TB", matching
 * `formatBytesCli`'s (unchanged) +Infinity behavior. See the dedicated test
 * below for the full explanation; reported in the PR body.
