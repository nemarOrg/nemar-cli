/**
 * The cure of a reason, as a terminal prints it, pinned reason by reason (ADR 0102, section 5).
 *
 * Phase 4 splits each cure into text a page can print and the command a terminal runs. The
 * split must not move one byte of what the CLI, the email and the gate's refusal message print,
 * so this block holds the composed cures as test-local literals captured from the tree BEFORE
 * the split, and imports no constant that the split touches. It is never edited by a later
 * commit: that is the proof that the CLI's text did not move.
 *
 * CI TIER: unit-pure. Pure: no database, no network, no spawn.
