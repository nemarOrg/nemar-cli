/**
 * A re-pull with its pull request open, built once per suite the way production builds it, for the
 * suites of what follows `pr_open` (epic #1046 phase 6, #1912; ADR 0111): `resume`, the merge gate,
 * `pr-reviews` and the release.
 *
 * Everything NEMAR's is real. The mirror and its upstream are `repull-fixture.ts`'s real git and
 * git-annex repositories, served as bare `file://` origins; the NEMAR API is the REAL datasets,
 * admin and users routers over bun:sqlite with every migration applied (`repull-full-app.ts`),
 * reached through TEST_API_URL; S3 is the scrub's stand-in driven by the REAL `aws` CLI for the
 * copy and by the Worker's own signed requests for the lock; GitHub is the suites' `Bun.serve()`
 * stand-in, with live heads read from the bare origin, a merge that squash-commits onto the origin's
 * `main` the way GitHub does with the message it is sent, and the tag and comparison reads the
 * Worker's release route makes. No mocks. The Worker runs as `production` against stand-ins only,
 * because an `on` dataset is re-pulled only there and its identifier screen is bound to the row;
 * nothing it reaches is a real service. Production ignores `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` (the fence in
 * `testS3EndpointOverride`), so the Worker addresses the AWS host as it does there, and the world
 * sends that request to the S3 stand-in at the fetch boundary (`withS3Standin`).
 *
 * The world is made once (`execute` to `pr_open`, about thirty seconds) and every test starts from a
 * snapshot of it: the origin's and upstream's refs, the bucket, the database, GitHub's pull requests.
