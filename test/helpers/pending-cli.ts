/**
 * The harness shared by the CLI tests of the pending-validation output
 * (test/publish-pending-cli.test.ts and test/publish-status-pending-cli.test.ts):
 * a stand-in backend, an isolated config directory, and a way to run the real
 * CLI against them.
 *
 * The CLI is a real subprocess (`bun run src/index.ts ...`) pointed at the
 * stand-in through config.json (the account's apiUrl) with a placeholder key.
 * The stand-in answers the two calls every invocation makes on its own (the
 * notices banner and the facets refresh) and the routes under test. It is the
 * HTTP condition the CLIENT is checked against, not a replacement for any CLI
 * logic. The bodies it sends have the key sets the real route sends, which
 * backend/test/publish-request-ci-pending.test.ts pins from the route itself.
 * Nothing here may reach the network, the real API or a real repository: the
 * child gets a dead proxy for everything except loopback.
 *
 * This file is outside the `test/*.test.ts` glob, so it is not sorted into a CI
 * tier itself; the test files that import it must still avoid the names test.yml
 * greps for (the live-backend environment variable, the request helper and the
 * CLI-runner helper), comments included.
