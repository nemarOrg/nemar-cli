/**
 * The delete-old stage, run as the real CLI against the S3 stand-in. It is the one irreversible
 * stage, so most of what is tested here is the ways it must refuse, and that when it does run it
 * removes every version AND delete marker by id with the governance bypass, leaves the new keys
 * alone, and proves the result with a fresh listing.
 *
 * One dataset is carried through plan, hash, assemble and verify once. Each test restores that
 * state and a pristine working directory (`delete-harness.ts`). What must be true before an old
 * key may go is in `delete-preconditions.test.ts`: the two files are one suite, split so CI can
 * run them on different runners.
