/**
 * Pins the webhooks router's route table across the #902/#905 webhooks.ts split.
 *
 * Hono's `.routes` lists one entry per handler in each registration chain.
 * Every webhook route is a single bare handler (auth is inline in each
 * handler body, not middleware), so every count is 1. Pinning the per-route
 * ENTRY COUNT catches a handler silently dropped or a middleware silently
 * added while code moves between files — not just a lost route.
 *
 * Counts are compared as an unordered map: the split regroups registrations
 * by trust model (routes/webhooks/github.ts vs routes/callbacks/*.ts), and
 * all webhook paths are distinct static paths, so registration order is not
 * load-bearing.
 *
 * Expected values were captured from webhooks.ts as of #905 commit 1, BEFORE
 * any code moved. If this test fails after an intentional route change,
 * update the map in the same commit and say so in the commit message.
