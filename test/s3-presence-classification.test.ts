/**
 * Telling "the object is not there" from "the question did not get asked" (#1380, #1392).
 *
 * This classification is the entire reason `headS3Objects` and `probeS3PrefixAccess`
 * exist rather than a bare exit-code check. `s3://nemar` denies anonymous
 * ListBucket, so S3 answers a missing key with 403 as readily as it answers an
 * expired session or a signature with no session token -- and a migration that
 * reads those alike either strands content or refuses a healthy dataset.
 *
 * Driven against a real `aws` executable on PATH: a shim that prints the strings
 * the AWS CLI actually prints. No library is stubbed and no return value is
 * replaced; the code under test shells out exactly as it does in production.
