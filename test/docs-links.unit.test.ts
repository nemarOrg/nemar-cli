/**
 * Every `docs.nemar.org` page URL this repo points at must be a page that
 * exists (epic #1336 phase 1, issue #1339, ADR 0057).
 *
 * ADR 0057 makes the docs site the canonical retrieval surface and takes
 * repository access out of the retrieval contract. From here on, `AGENTS.md`
 * and `.rules/*` stop describing things and start POINTING at them, so a
 * pointer that resolves to nothing is not a cosmetic problem: it is the
 * reference material being unreachable for the agent that was told to read it.
 *
 * `starlight-links-validator` already fails the docs build on a broken
 * internal link. This is the other direction, and nothing covered it. Note
 * that the docs plugin also would not catch this even inside its own repo: it
 * defaults to `sameSitePolicy: 'ignore'`, so an absolute
 * `https://docs.nemar.org/...` link is invisible to it.
 *
 * TWO THINGS HERE ARE NOT OBVIOUS AND BOTH WERE LEARNED THE HARD WAY.
 *
 * **Resolution is a slug map, not path arithmetic.** `slug:` frontmatter
 * decouples the source path from the published URL in both directions. Today
 * `src/content/docs/platform/zarr.md` declares `slug: platform/zarr/mental-model`
 * while `/platform/zarr/` is served by `platform/zarr/index.md`, so guessing
 * candidate paths both falsely passes `/platform/zarr/` and falsely fails
 * `/platform/zarr/mental-model/`. The docs repo's own
 * `scripts/check-admin-gating.ts` carries the same warning.
 *
 * **The comparison reads a git ref, never the working tree.** Two exploration
 * passes over the sibling checkout disagreed about whether any page uses
 * `slug:` at all, because one read a working tree parked on a feature branch
 * that was missing twenty-odd pages. A checker whose answer depends on which
 * branch someone left checked out reports drift that is not there, and the
 * blame lands on the checker.
 *
 * That narrows the failure mode rather than removing it: a stale local `main`
 * is the same skew one level removed, so `origin/main` is preferred over
 * `main`. On a developer machine with an unfetched clone the answer can still
 * be stale, and only CI, which checks out fresh, is authoritative.
 *
 * Real filesystem and real git, no mocks. `.rules/testing.md`: prove the test
 * fails.
