/**
 * Drift check between `shared/contract/account-copy.ts` and the website's
 * transcription of it (#1268, ADR 0045; nemarOrg/website#310).
 *
 * The two repos share no package, so the website's `src/lib/account-copy.ts` is
 * a copy of this contract rather than an import of it. A copy with nothing
 * watching it is a fork with a delay, which is what this test exists to
 * prevent: every key that is NOT `cli.`-prefixed must exist there, carrying the
 * same string.
 *
 * **It reads the website file as TEXT, and does not import it.** A dynamic
 * import would drag that repo's module graph (astro, vite-resolved specifiers)
 * in for a table of string constants and would fail for reasons that have
 * nothing to do with drift. Text extraction has one requirement in exchange,
 * documented in account-copy.ts and enforced below: every value is a plain
 * string literal.
 *
 * **The extractor is proved on THIS file, which is the same shape.** A
 * developer running the suite may have no website checkout at all, so the
 * reader that will be pointed at a file they cannot see is first pointed at one
 * they can — and those assertions run either way.
 *
 * **CI IS THE POINT, and it used to be excluded from it.** This block ended in
 * an early `return` when no website checkout was found, so the parity claim was
 * enforced on developer machines and nowhere else — a green required check that
 * had never once compared the two files. The `unit-pure` job now sparse-checks
 * out `nemarOrg/website`'s `src/lib/account-copy.ts` (public, no token) and
 * names it in `NEMAR_WEBSITE_ACCOUNT_COPY`.
 *
 * So there are two modes, and the difference between them is deliberate:
 *
 *   `NEMAR_WEBSITE_ACCOUNT_COPY` set   that path IS the contract. A file that
 *                                      is not there FAILS, naming the path and
 *                                      the variable — because the only way to
 *                                      reach it is a checkout step that broke,
 *                                      and a silent skip would hand the check
 *                                      straight back to nobody.
 *   unset                              search the sibling checkouts a developer
 *                                      is likely to have. Absent is a VISIBLE
 *                                      skip (bun's `describe.skipIf`), not a
 *                                      pass: a skipped test is reported as
 *                                      skipped, and an early `return` is
 *                                      reported as success.
 *
 * The website's own `test/account-copy-drift.test.ts` is the mirror image of
 * this file, and is getting the same treatment via `NEMAR_CLI_ACCOUNT_COPY`.
