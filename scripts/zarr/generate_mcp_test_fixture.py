"""One-time generator for a synthetic `view/*` pyramid chunk fixture the MCP
`render_overview` tests need (epic #1065 phase 3, issue #1295, PR review item
1).

WHY THIS EXISTS. `render_overview`'s tests need a REAL ADR 0028 derived (SSS-
filtered MEG) store, so `computeProvenanceEnvelope`'s sss-iff-derived
refinement is exercised against a store that actually carries `sss` -- the
bug this fixture's test catches (`buildProjection` in `list-recordings.ts`
was dropping `sss`/`units_report`, making every derived-store envelope
throw) only shows up on a store where `derived: true`. The real live store
(`on003392`, `sub-01/meg/sub-01_task-localizer_meg.zarr`, already committed
as `test/fixtures/zarr-index-on003392-meg-sss-slice.json`) is 320 channels;
its own coarsest view level (`view/4`, 266 columns, one chunk) is 327 KB
compressed -- over the ~150 KB budget for a committed test fixture. So this
script writes a SYNTHETIC chunk with a much smaller channel/column count
instead, encoded with the SAME codec configuration biosigIO's real
`ZarrExporter` uses for a view chunk (`numcodecs.Blosc`, `cname="zstd"`,
`clevel=5`, byte shuffle, one block per chunk) -- so the bytes this script
produces decode through the exact same path
(`backend/src/services/blosc-decode.ts`'s `decodeBloscZstdInt16`) a real
store's chunk would.

GEOMETRY (single-chunk MEG fixture). 8 channels, 132 columns, one chunk
(`view/3/c/0/0/0` for a synthetic 3-level pyramid over 8500 samples:
`floor(8500/4)=2125`, `floor(2125/4)=531`, `floor(531/4)=132` -- the
biosigio stopping rule halts after 132 because 531 is still above the
512-sample floor but 132 itself is at or below it). Data is a simple
per-channel sine wave (min/max envelope of a few periods across the 132
columns), scaled into a distinct int16 range per channel so the pixel-level
render tests have real variation to check, not a rerun of `nm000329`'s
content -- just a different, small, real-shaped signal.

GEOMETRY (multi-chunk fixture, PR review item 15). A second, SEPARATE
synthetic store/group: 4 channels, 117 columns in ONE view level
(`n_samples=468`, `n_view_levels=1`: `floor(468/4)=117`), chunked at
`view_chunk_columns=50` -- three chunks, `50 + 50 + 17` (a short last
chunk, exercising `reassembleViewChunks`' "chunks must arrive in `k` order,
the last may be shorter" case at the route level, not just the pure-function
level). nm000329's own real `view/3` (the smallest level actually needing 3
chunks) is ~490 KB across its three chunks -- over the fixture budget -- so
this is synthetic too, same codec configuration.

GEOMETRY (sharded level-0 fixture, epic #1065 phase 4, issue #1296). A THIRD,
separate synthetic store for `read_window` taste mode: a small sharded LEVEL-0
signal array (not a view pyramid chunk) using the SAME `sharding_indexed`
codec configuration real level-0 arrays use (`test/fixtures/zarr-array-level0.zarr.json`,
nm000329's real `eeg_250hz` level-0 `zarr.json`) -- `bytes` + `blosc`
(zstd/clevel 5/shuffle/typesize 2) inner codecs, `bytes` + `crc32c` index
codecs, `index_location: "end"`. 4 channels, `chunk_samples` 1000,
`shard_samples` 4000, `n_samples` 6500.

EVERY shard's footer carries `shard_samples // chunk_samples` == 4 entries,
including the boundary shard: the entry count is a property of the chunk grid,
not of how much real data lands in that particular shard. An earlier version
of this generator wrote shard 1 with only THREE entries, matching a reader bug
that computed the count from the remaining extent; because generator and
reader agreed, the whole suite was green while production data was being
misread by 11 chunks (see `sharding.ts`'s module doc for the measured
evidence). The rule here is now the spec's: a chunk whose nominal span lies
entirely past `n_samples` is an ABSENT ENTRY, never an omitted one.

So shard 0 covers samples [0, 4000) with 4 entries and shard 1 covers
[4000, 8000) with 4 entries, of which local index 3 ([7000, 8000)) is absent
because it is wholly past `n_samples`. Local index 2 ([6000, 7000)) STRADDLES
the array's real end and is present and stored FULL SIZE (1000 columns), with
columns past sample 6500 written as `fill_value` 0 -- Zarr never emits a
narrower chunk, verified against nm000329's own final present chunk, which
decodes to 63 x 1000 for 750 real samples. Shard 0's
local index 2 ([2000, 3000)) is deliberately marked ABSENT (both footer fields
`2**64 - 1`) so the mid-array fill-value path is exercised too, and because
its neighbours' byte offsets skip straight past it, it is what exercises
`planShardReads`' "do not coalesce across an absent entry" rule at the route
level, not just the pure-function level. Every present
chunk's digital value is `channel * 100 + (global_sample % chunk_samples)` --
deterministic and hand-computable from the sample index alone, so a test can
assert an exact physical value (`digital * scale[channel] + offset[channel]`)
without re-implementing the encoder. `scale`/`offset` are `[0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
2.0]` / `[10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0]`, real-shaped per-channel arrays matching
the live fixture's `attributes.scale`/`attributes.offset` convention. Writes
`backend/test/fixtures/mcp/nm099500-shard-0.bin`,
`backend/test/fixtures/mcp/nm099500-shard-1.bin` (each a full shard object:
concatenated inner-chunk blosc frames, in local-index order, immediately
followed by its own `n_inner * 16 + 4`-byte footer -- `n_inner` little-endian
uint64 `(offset, nbytes)` pairs plus a 4-byte crc32c placeholder, never
verified by the reader), and
`backend/test/fixtures/mcp/nm099500-level0-zarr.json` (the array's own
`zarr.json`, `attributes.scale`/`attributes.offset` included). The dataset id
`nm099500` is fictitious -- test-fixture-only, chosen INSIDE the dataset id
band `isValidDatasetId` (`backend/src/services/datasetId.ts`) accepts (numeric
part `<= 99999`): this fixture's index.json is read through the real zarr
sub-app (`createZarrDataRoutes`), whose own `isPublicDataset` gate calls
`isValidDatasetId` before touching D1 at all, unlike `mcp-route.test.ts`'s/
`mcp-overview.test.ts`'s `nm5000xx`-band ids, which only ever reach tools that
short-circuit before a real index.json fetch.

USAGE. `uv run --with numcodecs --with pyarrow python3 scripts/zarr/generate_mcp_test_fixture.py`
from the repo root. Writes
`backend/test/fixtures/mcp/on003392-synthetic-meg-view3-c-0-0-0.bin`,

`backend/test/fixtures/mcp/two-group-events.parquet`,
`backend/test/fixtures/mcp/invalid-row-events.parquet`,
and the sharded level-0 fixture set above, printing each one's byte size.
Re-run only if a fixture's geometry needs to change; the committed bytes are
