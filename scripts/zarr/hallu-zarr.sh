# NEMAR SDSC Hallu Zarr conversion (queue-driven)
#
# Purpose: Build the derived, latest-only Zarr serving copies for NEMAR public
#          datasets ON Hallu (ample compute + a 1 Gbps link, no GitHub Actions
#          120-min cap) and push them to s3://nemar/<id>/zarr/. Epic
#          nemarOrg/nemar-cli#684; the conversion engine replaces the
#          run-generate-zarr.yml Actions path for bulk/backfill.
#
# Design: self-contained, EPHEMERAL, and crash-safe via a persistent SQLite
#         queue (scripts/zarr/zarr_queue.py). Each run:
#           1. reconcile -- enqueue every public dataset whose latest version
#              isn't converted yet, and reset any `inprogress` job left by a
#              crashed/rebooted run back to `pending`.
#           2. drain     -- claim the oldest job, clone the dataset's metadata
#              only (`nemar dataset download --no-data`, seconds), then the
#              biosigIO driver STREAMs each recording's annex blob from
#              s3://nemar/<id>/objects/<key> just-in-time -> convert -> push,
#              JOBS recordings in PARALLEL (ProcessPoolExecutor), onto NVMe
#              scratch; `rm -rf` the scratch copy and mark the job done (or fail
#              w/ backoff). Repeat until the queue is empty (or --limit).
#              Streaming + parallelism start converting immediately, never hold
#              the whole dataset, and saturate Hallu's cores on the CPU-bound
#              resample/compress.
#         flock keeps a single long backfill draining across hourly cron ticks
#         (a later tick finds the lock held and exits). As long as the box is on,
#         the cron fires and the queue resumes exactly where it left off. The
#         drain also stops itself at a dataset boundary when origin/$DRIVER_REF
#         moves, so a merged driver change reaches the node on the next tick
#         instead of waiting out the backfill (#1129).
#
# Usage:
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh                      # reconcile + drain the queue
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --limit 20           # cap datasets per run (paced)
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --dataset nm000132   # one dataset now (bypasses the queue)
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --stats              # print queue status and exit
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --requeue failed     # dry-run: what a requeue would revive
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --requeue all --execute   # revive failed + data_failed
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --backfill-dir-formats            # dry-run: the #1172 sweep
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --backfill-dir-formats --execute  # requeue what it found
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --preview-engine-bump             # what an engine bump costs
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --test                     # against api-test.nemar.org / nemar-dev
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --test --print-config      # resolved --test config, no side effects
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --print-config             # resolved prod config, no side effects
#
# --requeue exists because the retry budget for `failed` was spent on OOM-killed
# workers taking whole datasets down (#1110), and `data_failed` was reachable by
# a classifier that recorded a runtime out-of-memory as a permanent property of
# the data (#1111). Both give-ups predate the fixes, so they deserve one more
# attempt; a genuine data failure simply returns to data_failed next run.
#
# --backfill-dir-formats is the one-off recovery for the cohort stranded before
# the queue stamped an engine version (#1172): MEG/iEEG datasets converted before
# epic #1095 taught discovery to see MEF3 `.mefd`, CTF `.ds` and 4D/BTi recording
# DIRECTORIES. Those runs found nothing, succeeded, and were marked `done`, so
# neither `reconcile` (no version change) nor the engine stamp (added after they
# converted) can reach them. It reads the published index and the dataset file
# list to identify them by evidence, and requeues only with --execute.
#
# Every conversion rebuilds the whole dataset (the driver's --clean) so the
# serving copy mirrors the current dataset. --clean RECONCILES rather than
# erases: each store is synced with --delete and only stores that no longer
# exist in HEAD are removed, after a successful conversion (ADR 0023).
#
# Crontab (sibling of hallu-sync, offset to :30):
#   30 * * * * /path/to/hallu-zarr.sh >> /mnt/local/zarr-state/.nm-zarr-cron.log 2>&1

# --- Test-mode pre-pass (nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1180, epic #1181 phase 3) ---------
# A second, independently-stated Hallu invocation against zarr-test.nemar.org /
# nemar-dev, not a code fork: --test is a scan over "$@" that runs BEFORE the
# Config block below and exports a default for each variable ONLY when it is
# still unset, so Config's existing "${VAR:-default}" everywhere just resolves
# to the test value instead of the prod one. This has to be a separate pre-pass
# rather than a case arm in the real parser further down, because the real
# parser runs AFTER Config has already read its defaults -- too late to steer
# them. --test is deliberately left in "$@": the real parser (below) still
# consumes it, to record TEST_MODE=1 for the "[test]" log prefix, without a
# second parse of the arguments.
#
# TEST_PREPASS_SEEN is the one variable this pre-pass sets that nothing else
# derives or overrides: a raw record of "--test was literally present in the
# original argv", independent of whatever the real parser below does with it.
# The guard rails further down key off THIS, not off the real parser's
# TEST_MODE, because a value-taking flag with a permissive parser can consume
# the following token as ITS OWN value -- `--dataset --test` used to leave
# `--test` swallowed as a dataset id, so TEST_MODE stayed unset and the guard
# block (which checked TEST_MODE) never ran at all, even though this pre-pass
# had already applied test defaults on top of whatever prod values were
# ambient. `--dataset`/`--limit` now refuse a value starting with "--" (see
# the arg parser below), which closes that specific hole, but the guard
# rails no longer trust TEST_MODE to agree with reality regardless: as long
# as this pre-pass's own scan saw "--test" anywhere in argv, the guards run.
#
# ZARR_JOBS defaults to 4, not nproc like the prod default: a test instance
# runs on the SAME Hallu box as the prod backfill and must not contend with it
# for cores.
#
# TEST_API_URL is NOT part of issue #1180's env-var inventory -- that
# inventory covers this script and the Python driver/queue, both of which
# already take API_BASE/--api-base. It missed that convert_dataset() also
# shells out to the separate `nemar` CLI binary (`nemar dataset download`),
# whose own API base resolution (src/lib/api/client.ts getApiUrl()) is
# entirely independent of API_BASE: it reads TEST_API_URL first, then a
# stored account config, then defaults to api.nemar.org. Without this, the
# metadata clone step in --test mode looks up the dataset against PROD and
# fails "Dataset not found" for a dev-only xx0999NN exemplar, discovered live
# against xx099905 during this phase's verification. TEST_API_URL is existing
# CLI plumbing (already used for staging e2e tests, AGENTS.md's "isolated
# NEMAR_CONFIG_DIR" pattern), not a new mechanism -- this just wires --test
# into the hook that was already there.

# --- Config (environment-overridable) ----------------------------------------
# ZARR_BASE is the SINGLE local drive this pipeline lives on. Both the hot
# per-recording scratch AND the persistent state (queue db, venv, driver clone,
# logs) hang off it, so the whole pipeline touches exactly one filesystem and has
# NO network (NFS) dependency: NFS made every Python import, SQLite lock, and stat
# a network round-trip -- too much tension/traffic on the hot path, and
# SQLite-over-NFS locking is fragile. All state here is rebuildable (venv/clone
# via setup(); the queue via `reconcile`) and the real outputs live in S3, so
# single-drive-local is the right durability trade. Moving to another machine is
# a one-line change here (or set ZARR_BASE in the environment / crontab).
#
# WORK_DIR is the EPHEMERAL per-recording scratch: the driver streams each annex
# blob here and N parallel workers build temp Zarr stores before upload, so it
# MUST be fast local disk. Only this subtree is wiped between recordings; the
# sibling STATE_DIR is never touched by the cleanup.

# sweep_orphaned_scratch() (below) deletes stray `tmp*` entries under WORK_DIR
# on the theory that holding the single-instance lock -- which lives under
# STATE_DIR -- proves nothing under WORK_DIR is owned by anyone else. That
# holds only while WORK_DIR and STATE_DIR belong to the SAME deployment. A
# second deployment that shares one of the two directories with this one
# (e.g. it overrides WORK_DIR to point somewhere private but leaves
# STATE_DIR at the shared default, or vice versa) is invisible to this
# lock -- it holds a different lock file under its own STATE_DIR, so it can
# be mid-conversion under a WORK_DIR this run is about to sweep. That is
# exactly how an in-flight on007808 recording was destroyed.
#
# The simplest sound rule: only sweep when both directories were resolved
# the SAME way -- both left at their ZARR_BASE-relative defaults, or both
# explicitly overridden (as --test's pre-pass does, pointing both at a
# dedicated *-test tree so its sweep stays safe and stays on). Exactly one
# overridden means the other is a shared default this run does not own
# alone, so skip. Checked here, right after ZARR_WORK_DIR/ZARR_STATE_DIR are
# resolved into WORK_DIR/STATE_DIR (and after --test's pre-pass has had its
# chance to set both), so the decision is available to --print-config too
# (--print-config exits before sweep_orphaned_scratch is ever defined).

# file is one `git add -A` away from being committed. Hence the STATE_DIR default,
# which sits outside the clone alongside the queue DB and the venv.
#
# The beside-the-script fallback does NOT carry a token through that move, and it
# would be dangerous to believe it does. It resolves against wherever the script
# currently IS, so post-cutover it points inside the clone -- never at the old
# hand-copy directory the token actually sat in. Relocating the token to STATE_DIR
# is a required manual step of the cutover, not something this fallback does for
# you. The fallback covers only the other deployment shape: script and secrets
# kept together somewhere outside a checkout.
#
# An absent token is otherwise SILENT: both callback POSTs below skip when it is
# empty, so conversion keeps succeeding and uploading while D1's zarr_status
# quietly stops updating -- a botched cutover would surface only as a dashboard
# that stopped advancing. Warn instead. It stays non-fatal because the callback is
# only D1 bookkeeping; the viewer reads index.json from S3, which is still written.
# Deliberately a function, called just before the conversion loop rather than at
# top level. Only convert_dataset() reads the token, and --stats/--requeue exit

# the concurrent write, which is a single fast UPDATE.
# `--preview-engine-bump` answers "what would a bump cost" BEFORE one lands, and
# is the reason ADR 0033 can claim a bump is visible rather than merely loud
# after the fact. It runs `engine-preview`, which touches no network and changes
# no job's STATE -- it only counts what a bump would re-queue. It is not
# literally read-only: `zarr_queue.py`'s `main()` connects for every subcommand,
# and `connect` runs `migrate_schema`, whose additive ALTER and `engine_version`
# seed are by design idempotent and re-run on every connect. So a preview on a
# node that has never run the current queue schema does write those, exactly as
# the next reconcile would. That is safe ahead of the lock and of setup(), like
# --requeue and for the same reasons: SQLite's own locking covers it, and it is
# the same statements a concurrent drain has already run.
#
# Note this deliberately does NOT run a real reconcile with --no-engine-requeue.
# That would be a preview with side effects: reconcile enqueues new datasets,

# The drift guard above answers "is this script stale relative to the repo it was

# and during a backfill that is the question that matters: a run does not end
# until the queue is empty, so setup() never re-runs and the deployed driver is
# frozen for the whole drain. Measured once, and it is not a small window --
# Hallu ran a driver two deploys behind for two days, missing the entire epic
# #1108 memory work, because the run holding the lock had started before the
# cutover (#1129).
#
# So re-check the tracked ref BETWEEN datasets and stop cleanly when it moves.
# One ls-remote per dataset is noise against per-dataset conversion times
# measured in minutes, and the queue persists across runs, so stopping costs
# nothing but the next cron tick.
#
# A failed ls-remote must NEVER stop a backfill: a network blip is not a reason
# to halt hours of work, and the worst case of ignoring it is that the redeploy
# waits for the next dataset boundary.
