# NEMAR SDSC Hallu Zarr conversion (queue-driven)
#
# Purpose: Build the derived, latest-only Zarr serving copies for NEMAR public
#          datasets ON Hallu (ample compute + a 1 Gbps link, no GitHub Actions
#          120-min cap) and push them to s3://nemar/<id>/zarr/. Epic
#          nemarOrg/nemar-cli#684; the conversion engine replaces the
#          run-generate-zarr.yml Actions path for bulk/backfill.
#
# Design: self-contained, EPHEMERAL, and crash-safe via a persistent SQLite
#         queue (scripts/zarr/zarr_queue.py). Each run:
#           1. reconcile -- enqueue every public dataset whose latest version
#              isn't converted yet, and reset any `inprogress` job left by a
#              crashed/rebooted run back to `pending`.
#           2. drain     -- claim the oldest job, clone the dataset's metadata
#              only (`nemar dataset download --no-data`, seconds), then the
#              biosigIO driver STREAMs each recording's annex blob from
#              s3://nemar/<id>/objects/<key> just-in-time -> convert -> push,
#              JOBS recordings in PARALLEL (ProcessPoolExecutor), onto NVMe
#              scratch; `rm -rf` the scratch copy and mark the job done (or fail
#              w/ backoff). Repeat until the queue is empty (or --limit).
#              Streaming + parallelism start converting immediately, never hold
#              the whole dataset, and saturate Hallu's cores on the CPU-bound
#              resample/compress.
#         flock keeps a single long backfill draining across hourly cron ticks
#         (a later tick finds the lock held and exits). As long as the box is on,
#         the cron fires and the queue resumes exactly where it left off.
#
# Usage:
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh                      # reconcile + drain the queue
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --limit 20           # cap datasets per run (paced)
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --dataset nm000132   # one dataset now (bypasses the queue)
#   ./hallu-zarr.sh --stats              # print queue status and exit
#
# Every conversion rebuilds the whole dataset (the driver's --clean) so the
# serving copy mirrors the current dataset. --clean RECONCILES rather than
# erases: each store is synced with --delete and only stores that no longer
# exist in HEAD are removed, after a successful conversion (ADR 0023).
#
# Crontab (sibling of hallu-sync, offset to :30):
#   30 * * * * /path/to/hallu-zarr.sh >> /mnt/local/zarr-state/.nm-zarr-cron.log 2>&1
#
# Prereqs: curl, jq, git, git-annex, nemar CLI, aws, uv, python3 in PATH.

# ZARR_BASE is the SINGLE local drive this pipeline lives on. Both the hot
# per-recording scratch AND the persistent state (queue db, venv, driver clone,
# logs) hang off it, so the whole pipeline touches exactly one filesystem and has
# NO network (NFS) dependency: NFS made every Python import, SQLite lock, and stat
# a network round-trip -- too much tension/traffic on the hot path, and
# SQLite-over-NFS locking is fragile. All state here is rebuildable (venv/clone
# via setup(); the queue via `reconcile`) and the real outputs live in S3, so
# single-drive-local is the right durability trade. Moving to another machine is
# a one-line change here (or set ZARR_BASE in the environment / crontab).
#
# WORK_DIR is the EPHEMERAL per-recording scratch: the driver streams each annex
# blob here and N parallel workers build temp Zarr stores before upload, so it
# MUST be fast local disk. Only this subtree is wiped between recordings; the
# sibling STATE_DIR is never touched by the cleanup.
