"""NEMAR Zarr serving-copy generator (epic nemarOrg/nemar-cli#684, Stream B).

Runs on the SDSC Hallu cron, driven by ``scripts/zarr/hallu-zarr.sh`` (ADR 0029).
It previously lived in nemarDatasets/.github and ran as run-generate-zarr.yml;
that workflow is retired -- Actions cannot finish a large dataset inside the
120-minute cap. Converts the BIDS recordings that changed since the last
conversion into per-recording biosigIO Zarr v3 serving stores, uploads them to
``s3://<bucket>/<id>/zarr/...`` (LATEST-ONLY: overwrite in place, delete on
source removal), maintains ``s3://<bucket>/<id>/zarr/index.json``, and writes a
callback body the driver script POSTs to ``/webhooks/zarr-ready``.

The conversion itself is biosigIO (``Recording.from_file -> bids.apply_events_tsv
-> rec.to_zarr``); this driver owns the BIDS-tree orchestration: change
detection, annex-content materialization, S3 sync, and the index.

Design notes
------------
* The dataset repo is cloned by the workflow (full history, ``--no-checkout``);
  this script reads the tree with git plumbing (``ls-tree``/``cat-file``/``diff``)
  exactly like ``emit_manifest.py``, and pulls annex *content* from
  ``s3://<bucket>/<id>/objects/<key>`` with authenticated ``aws s3 cp`` (works for
  private datasets, unlike the archive workflow's public-HTTP fetch), or from
  that key's git-annex chunks when the dataset was uploaded with chunking
  (``fetch_annex_object``).
* Incremental: the prior ``index.json`` records the commit it was built from;
  we ``git diff <prior>..HEAD`` and convert only the affected recordings, mapping
  a changed companion (``.fdt``/``.eeg``/``.vmrk``) or ``*_events.tsv`` back to its
  sibling recording. ``--full`` (or a missing/!ancestor prior) converts everything.
* BIDS raw only: ``derivatives/``, ``sourcedata/``, and ``code/`` never hold a BIDS
  raw recording, so ``is_excluded_from_discovery`` excludes them (and BIDS-reserved
  MEG calibration filenames) from every discovery path -- ``is_primary``, the
  directory-recording derivation, and the diff-based companion/events routing. This
  scope matches nemarOrg/nemar-cli ADR 0027 (the backend dispatch-gate side of the
  same decision). Excluding a tree from *future* conversion must not be read as
  "gone from HEAD": ``compute_clean_orphans`` explicitly protects already-published
  stores under an excluded tree from ``--clean``'s orphan-removal so this scope
  change alone never deletes a store; that cleanup is separate, explicitly-authorized
  follow-up work (nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1095 / nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1097).
* Directory-keyed recordings: CTF ``.ds``, MEF3 ``.mefd``, and 4D/BTi are each a
  DIRECTORY of files git tracks individually, never the directory itself.
  ``.ds``/``.mefd`` are derived from an extension on a path component
  (``dir_recording_of`` / ``is_dir_recording`` / ``dir_recordings``); 4D/BTi carries
  no extension at all (BIDS names it a bare ``..._meg/`` directory), so it is
  detected by CONTENT instead -- a ``c,rf*`` processed-data file alongside a sibling
  ``config`` file (``bti_recordings``), the same gate biosigIO's importer uses, so
  the two sides agree on what counts as a recording. Requires biosigio>=1.2.3 (the
  release that added ``.mefd``/4D-BTi import); see ``requirements.txt``.
* The pure helpers (path classification, worklist, index merge) carry the logic
  and are unit-tested in ``test_generate_zarr.py``; the I/O lives in ``main``.

    EEGLAB `.set` is deliberately absent from every streaming tuple, and stays on
    the in-memory path at any size. Two independent blockers, both verified
    against the installed MNE and biosigIO:

    1. A MATLAB v7.3 `.set` is an HDF5 container. MNE refuses it outright, and
       only biosigIO's own h5py importer reads it (the `[hdf5]` extra, added in
       1.2.4 for 544 such recordings across the archive). Streaming routes through
       MNE, so routing `.set` there would turn those 544 back into failures.
    2. For a classic `.set` whose samples are embedded in the MAT struct rather
       than a sibling `.fdt`, `preload=False` is a fiction: MNE's
       `_read_segment_file` detects `is_embedded` and calls `_readmat(preload=True)`,
       materializing the whole recording and caching it. Streaming such a file
       would load everything anyway AND add the scratch memmap on top -- strictly
       worse than the in-memory path it replaced.

    Only a classic `.set` with a sibling `.fdt` could genuinely stream, which is a
    subset, and biosigIO importer parity for units and channel handling would
    still need proving before relying on it. Large `.set` recordings are instead
    protected by the RLIMIT_DATA backstop (#1110) and by the temporary-vs-permanent
    verdict split (#1111), so one cannot take down a node or be buried forever.

    Large MNE-native recordings (BrainVision/FIF, CTF `.ds`, MEF3 `.mefd`) stream
    above ``STREAM_MIN_BYTES``; KIT `.con`/`.sqd`/`.kdf` and
    -- when biosigIO >= 1.2.0 -- EDF/BDF stream above the much lower KIT/EDF
    thresholds because their in-memory float64 blow-up OOMs a worker well below
    the common threshold. Everything else uses the faster
    in-memory path.

    Called both pre-materialization (``primary_local`` is still the git-relative
    path, e.g. the RAM-admission estimate in ``main``) and post-materialization
    (a real local path, from ``convert_recording``), so every branch here must
    decide from the path STRING alone -- never ``os.path.isdir`` or another

    that raw Internal Active Shielding data is not fit for analysis until the
    shielding's effect has been modeled out. ADR 0028 decides we correct it with
    Signal-Space Separation and serve the result -- but ONLY with the recording's own
    fine-calibration and cross-talk files, because uncalibrated Signal-Space
    Separation is a weaker correction whose quality varies by site and hardware, and
    serving it under the same label would make the two indistinguishable.

    So this is the honest decline: a permanent property of what the dataset ships,
    NOT in `RETRYABLE_CODES`. It exists to replace the opaque `file_read_error` that
    gave a user no way to tell an unreadable file from a policy decision."""

    BIDS requires UTF-8, but real datasets ship Latin-1/Windows-1252 sidecars
    (on005691's channels.tsv spells microvolts `µV` as the single byte 0xb5).
    A strict decode raised UnicodeDecodeError, which is not an OSError, so it
    escaped every caller uncoded and the job retried forever. A UTF-16 BOM
    (Windows "Unicode" text, `FF FE`/`FE FF`) is honored first: cp1252 would
    otherwise accept those bytes and hand every caller text with a NUL between
    each character. cp1252 is tried before latin-1 because it is what Windows
    tools actually write (and a superset of latin-1's printable range);
    latin-1 maps every byte, so this always returns.

    Behavior change for UTF-8 files with a BOM: the strict text-mode read
    kept the BOM as U+FEFF, so `json.loads` raised ValueError and the JSON
    callers (PowerLineFrequency, coordsystem, event descriptions) swallowed
    it and ignored the sidecar. The BOM is now dropped and those sidecars
    parse, so a rebuilt store for such a dataset can newly carry a power-line
    frequency, electrode coordinates or event descriptions it lacked before.
    That is the sidecar's declared content reaching the store, not a new
    guess; a UTF-8 BOM is still UTF-8, so it draws no warning. (A BOM'd TSV
    likewise no longer has its first column header spelled `\\ufeffname`.)

    The warning is issued once per path per process: an inherited sidecar
    (a top-level `eeg.json`, say) is re-read for every recording it applies
    to, and thousands of identical lines would bury the rest of the log.

      ``channel_labels_deduplicated`` map, ``{new_label: file_label}``.
    - ``unmatched_case_only``: the names differ only in case (EDF header
      ``FP1-F7``, sidecar ``Fp1-F7``; biosigio#136).

    ``unmatched_channels`` is present whenever there were store labels to
    join, so 0 is a positive statement that every store channel met a row;
    the rest appear only when non-zero. With no store labels (a store whose
    groups record none) there was no join, and the report is empty rather
    than a vacuous 0.
    biosigio 1.2.9 joins by exact match only, so a case-only difference is
    never applied and ``unmatched_case_only`` is a true statement about it.
    biosigio 1.2.10 (biosigio#140) also matches a row to the one channel that
    differs from it only in case, and reports each such match as
    ``matched_case_insensitive``, ``{sidecar_name: channel_label}``, in its

    count and a few examples, never the map). Pass that map as
    `matched_case_insensitive` and those channels count as matched, because the

    called ``round()`` because the two DIFFER: Python's ``round()`` is
    banker's rounding, which breaks an exact .5 tie toward the even integer
    (``round(0.5) == 0``, ``round(1.5) == 2``), while this ties UP everywhere
    (``0.5 -> 1``, ``1.5 -> 2``). A tie is not exotic here -- an onset of 0.5 s
    at 1 Hz, or any onset landing on a half sample at the serving rate, hits it
    -- and a client that reimplements the column with ``round()`` would disagree
    with the published value on exactly those rows, which is the failure the
    column exists to prevent.

    That is the whole formula, and the reason it is this simple is worth writing
    down once, because the point of publishing the column at all is that a client
    should not have to re-derive it (#1060):

    * biosigIO resamples level 0 to ``target_rate = min(native_rate, cap)`` with
      ``scipy.signal.resample_poly(x, up, down)``, ``up/down =
      Fraction(round(target), round(native))``, and trims/pads the result to
      ``n_out = round(n_native * target / native)``. So level 0 is exactly the
      grid ``t[n] = n / target_rate`` over the same span as the source -- both
      exporters, in-memory and streaming, share ``_resample_channel``.
    * ``resample_poly`` is ZERO-PHASE: it compensates the polyphase FIR's group
      delay internally, so output sample ``n`` is at absolute time ``n / rate``
      with no delay term to subtract. This is verified against a real
      1000 Hz -> 250 Hz recording in the test suite (nm000329) by correlating the
      served level-0 signal against the native samples taken at the same absolute
      times; a filter delay would show up there as a non-zero lag.

    The index is thus the only place the relation is known exactly -- a client
    that guesses `rate` from the acquisition rate, or that subtracts a delay it
    assumes is there, is wrong by a fraction of a sample everywhere the ratio is
    not an integer.

    NOT clamped to the group's length. An onset past the end of the recording is
    a property of the data, and a clamped index would be indistinguishable from
    an event that genuinely lands on the last sample; clients bound-check against
    `groups[].n_samples`, which the index publishes beside this.

    chanlocs never changes the count. So:

    - samples in a `.fdt` (`EEG.data` is the file name): biosigIO reshapes the

    - samples inline: the matrix's own row count (from its header, in MATLAB
      orientation; for v7.3 by biosigIO's transpose rule) must equal `nbchan`.
      A disagreement returns None: `nbchan` above the rows would refuse a
      faithful store, so the header vouches for nothing there.

    Both layouts are read: fields wrapped in an `EEG` struct (the first element

    `converted` is a list of store entries (each carries a `zarr` rel-path key);
    `removed_store_rels` are `*.zarr` rels to drop. Entries for unchanged stores
    are carried over from `prior`, normalized to the v3 shape (which includes
    re-keying a long `trial_types` value by its digest form, see
    `_normalize_store_entry`).

    `failures` is this run's typed data failures ({path, zarr, code, reason,
    detail}) -- recordings that will not convert without a change to the data or
    the converter. They are merged like stores: prior failures carry over, a path
    that converted (or whose store was removed) this run drops out, and this run's
    failures overlay.

    `pending` is this run's INFRA failures ({path, zarr, reason, last_error,
    last_attempt_utc}) -- recordings that have no store yet but are still expected
    to convert. Before v3 these were simply omitted, which is why on008083's five
    silently-lost recordings were indistinguishable from "still generating"
    forever (#1197). `attempts` is not supplied by the caller: it is a property of
    the recording's HISTORY, so it is carried from `prior_pending` and
    incremented here. At `PENDING_MAX_ATTEMPTS` the entry is promoted to a typed
    `retry_exhausted` failure carrying its last error as `detail`, which is what
    stops a permanently failing recording from consuming the queue forever.

    `discovered` (every raw recording at HEAD) makes the coverage invariant hold
    BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by hope: entries for paths that are not discovered
    are dropped, and discovered paths in none of the three lists become
    `not_attempted` pending entries. A partial run therefore still balances.

    `deferred` maps recordings the scratch gate would not admit to the text that
    explains it. A deferral is not an attempt and not a conversion, so it must
    neither spend an attempt nor make the index serve less than it did (a served
    store is not dropped by a rebuild that could not run).
    `seed` is the index as published (under ``--clean`` the merge is handed no
    `prior`, so this is the only place the deferred recordings' old entries live),
    and `seed_current` says whether the stores it serves are what this run would
    have written (`index_currency_problem` is None). For each deferred path:

    - a store in `seed` and `seed_current`: the store stays in the index, served
      exactly as before; nothing is owed;
    - a store that is stale (or any store carried by an incremental merge): the
      entry leaves the index, as a failure's does, and the recording is listed

    Never "auto" (biosigIO's default), and that is the whole point. "auto" looks
    for a SIBLING `_channels.tsv` next to the file it was handed, which is the
    wrong question twice over:

    * The file this driver hands the exporter is not the recording's own path. It
      is a scratch materialization in `work/`, and on the ADR 0028 MaxShield path
      it is the Signal-Space-Separated copy at `work/sss_<basename>`. Sibling
      detection there finds whatever this driver happened to stage, or nothing.
    * BIDS inheritance is not siblinghood. The sidecar that applies to
      `sub-01/eeg/..._eeg.edf` may live in `sub-01/` or at the dataset root; the
      resolution that finds it is `channels_tsv_for`, which is also what the
      channel-count fidelity gate consults. The gate and the conversion must
      agree about WHICH sidecar applies, or the gate is checking a different file
      than the one that shaped the store.

    So the path is always resolved from the ORIGINAL BIDS `primary` and passed
    explicitly, and "off" says "there is no applicable sidecar" rather than
    leaving the exporter to guess. biosigio>=1.2.7 accepts the path form on
    `Recording.from_file` AND `stream_to_zarr` and acts on it (biosigio#128,
    closing #127); on 1.2.6 the streaming exporter had no such parameter and
    `from_file` accepted a path and silently ignored it, which is why the pin is
    a floor and not a preference.

    Recovery is two-pass, because when a pool breaks you cannot tell WHICH of the
    in-flight recordings killed it:

    1. Parallel pass over the queue. On a break, the in-flight recordings are set
       aside as suspects and the executor is rebuilt to drain the rest.
    2. Serial pass over the suspects, one worker. A recording that dies here was
       running alone, so it is provably the culprit and only it is reported
       failed; every innocent suspect converts normally.

    Retrying suspects in PARALLEL instead would be wrong: the culprit kills the
    pool again, and an innocent recording that happened to be in flight for both
    breaks gets blamed. That is not hypothetical -- the tests caught exactly it.

    3. Serial memory retry (#1483), when ``memory_retry`` is given. A recording
       that failed with a retryable memory code (``RETRYABLE_CODES``) is held
       back instead of reported. Once the passes above are done, the node's RAM
       is no longer shared with the parallel pass, so ``memory_retry()`` is
       called ONCE, then, and returns ``(retry_ctx, retry_peak)``: the worker
       context and the per-recording reserve to retry with, read at that moment.
       Each held recording whose original reserve was below ``retry_peak`` is
       re-run alone with it, up to ``MEMORY_RETRY_MAX``; the rest are reported as
       they failed. Before this, such a failure waited 1h-7d for a retry round
       that rebuilt the whole dataset under the same budget and mostly failed the
       same way.

    Admission is re-evaluated against ``ceiling(running_peak, track_dir)``, by
    default `live_admission_ceiling` over this node's /proc with ``ram_ceiling``
    as its off-Linux fallback, whenever a recording finishes and at least every
    ``ADMISSION_RECHECK_SECONDS`` otherwise (#1483).

    Scratch disk is admitted the same way when ``scratch_peaks`` (primary ->
    projected peak bytes) is given: a recording is dispatched only while the sum
    of in-flight scratch peaks plus its own fits ``scratch_budget(in_flight)``
    (default: a `ScratchGate` over ``ctx["tmp"]``, which is handed the in-flight
    primaries so it can count what they hold). Unlike RAM there is no run-alone
    exception: a recording that does not fit while nothing is in flight can never
    be admitted this run, so it is handed back in ``deferred`` (a dict of
    recording -> the `last_error` text the index will carry) UNREPORTED. Before
    that, admission looks at the volume again ``SCRATCH_DEFER_RESAMPLES`` times,
    since one sample can land in someone else's spike. A memory-failed recording
    held for the serial retry that cannot fit there is reported as the memory
    failure it was, not deferred.

    # It used to be an unconditional `aws_cp` followed by a `head-object` for the
    # ETag. Two processes write this object -- a converter run and the non-raw
    # purge -- and both read it, work for minutes to hours, then write back what
    # they merged from that read. Whichever finished second silently reverted the
    # other: a purge that had just deleted 92 non-raw stores would be undone, or a
    # conversion's newly added stores would vanish from the document while their
    # chunks sat on S3 unreferenced. Nothing anywhere reported it -- both runs
    # exited 0 and both callbacks said "ready".
    #
    # So the PUT carries `--if-match` with the ETag read at the top of this run
    # (or `--if-none-match "*"` when there was no document then). A 412 means the
    # premise changed, and it is recoverable exactly once: re-read, re-merge this
    # run's results onto the NEWER document, and write again against its ETag.
    # The re-merge covers the document only -- the objects this run uploaded and
    # deleted are already on S3 and are not redone. A second 412 is abandoned
    # loudly through `write_failed_callback`: a third attempt has no reason to
    # win, and publishing an index computed from a body that is already stale
    # again is exactly the silent rollback this replaces.
