"""NEMAR Zarr serving-copy generator (epic nemarOrg/nemar-cli#684, Stream B).

Runs on the SDSC Hallu cron, driven by ``scripts/zarr/hallu-zarr.sh`` (ADR 0029).
It previously lived in nemarDatasets/.github and ran as run-generate-zarr.yml;
that workflow is retired -- Actions cannot finish a large dataset inside the
120-minute cap. Converts the BIDS recordings that changed since the last
conversion into per-recording biosigIO Zarr v3 serving stores, uploads them to
``s3://<bucket>/<id>/zarr/...`` (LATEST-ONLY: overwrite in place, delete on
source removal), maintains ``s3://<bucket>/<id>/zarr/index.json``, and writes a
callback body the driver script POSTs to ``/webhooks/zarr-ready``.

The conversion itself is biosigIO (``Recording.from_file -> bids.apply_events_tsv
-> rec.to_zarr``); this driver owns the BIDS-tree orchestration: change
detection, annex-content materialisation, S3 sync, and the index.

Design notes
------------
* The dataset repo is cloned by the workflow (full history, ``--no-checkout``);
  this script reads the tree with git plumbing (``ls-tree``/``cat-file``/``diff``)
  exactly like ``emit_manifest.py``, and pulls annex *content* from
  ``s3://<bucket>/<id>/objects/<key>`` with authenticated ``aws s3 cp`` (works for
  private datasets, unlike the archive workflow's public-HTTP fetch).
* Incremental: the prior ``index.json`` records the commit it was built from;
  we ``git diff <prior>..HEAD`` and convert only the affected recordings, mapping
  a changed companion (``.fdt``/``.eeg``/``.vmrk``) or ``*_events.tsv`` back to its
  sibling recording. ``--full`` (or a missing/!ancestor prior) converts everything.
* BIDS raw only: ``derivatives/``, ``sourcedata/``, and ``code/`` never hold a BIDS
  raw recording, so ``is_excluded_from_discovery`` excludes them (and BIDS-reserved
  MEG calibration filenames) from every discovery path -- ``is_primary``, the
  directory-recording derivation, and the diff-based companion/events routing. This
  scope matches nemarOrg/nemar-cli ADR 0027 (the backend dispatch-gate side of the
  same decision). Excluding a tree from *future* conversion must not be read as
  "gone from HEAD": ``compute_clean_orphans`` explicitly protects already-published
  stores under an excluded tree from ``--clean``'s orphan-removal so this scope
  change alone never deletes a store; that cleanup is separate, explicitly-authorized
  follow-up work (nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1095 / nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1097).
* Directory-keyed recordings: CTF ``.ds``, MEF3 ``.mefd``, and 4D/BTi are each a
  DIRECTORY of files git tracks individually, never the directory itself.
  ``.ds``/``.mefd`` are derived from an extension on a path component
  (``dir_recording_of`` / ``is_dir_recording`` / ``dir_recordings``); 4D/BTi carries
  no extension at all (BIDS names it a bare ``..._meg/`` directory), so it is
  detected by CONTENT instead -- a ``c,rf*`` processed-data file alongside a sibling
  ``config`` file (``bti_recordings``), the same gate biosigIO's importer uses, so
  the two sides agree on what counts as a recording. Requires biosigio>=1.2.3 (the
  release that added ``.mefd``/4D-BTi import); see ``requirements.txt``.
* The pure helpers (path classification, worklist, index merge) carry the logic
  and are unit-tested in ``test_generate_zarr.py``; the I/O lives in ``main``.

# `.tdat`/`.tidx`/`.tmet` per channel segment -- a real session can hold well over a

# neither ever appears in `git ls-tree` as one path -- each is derived from the files
# under it and treated as one recording keyed at the directory itself. Both are
# EXTENSION-keyed (the directory's own name ends in `.ds`/`.mefd`), which is what

# node's usable RAM -- BEFORE the load, so no OOM ever happens. The ceiling is the
