"""Purge already-published non-raw Zarr stores (nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1095,
tracked by nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1097).

nemarDatasets/.github#98 made `generate_zarr.py` raw-only (the converter
lived in that repo at the time; ADR 0029 later repatriated it here): `derivatives/`, `sourcedata/`, and
`code/` are no longer walked for NEW recordings. It deliberately left the
stores that earlier, tree-walking runs had already published under those
trees alone -- `compute_clean_orphans` in that file explicitly protects an
already-published store under an excluded tree from `--clean`'s own
orphan-removal, precisely so that raw-only scope change alone could never
mass-delete the ~4,721 stores (12% of all live stores at last count) that
predate it. Deleting them is separate, explicitly-authorized follow-up work,
and this script is that follow-up.

This is a standalone script, not a `generate_zarr.py` entry point (a
concurrent edit to that file cannot conflict with it), and it imports rather
than re-derives the raw/non-raw distinction: `is_excluded_from_discovery`,
`safe_store_prefix`, `_rm_recursive`, `s3_read_json`, and the S3
listing helpers all come from `generate_zarr.py` so the two files cannot drift
apart on what counts as "excluded" or how a store's S3 prefix is built. So does
the conditional index read/write pair (`read_index_with_etag`, `write_index`):
it was defined here first, because `aws_cp` cannot carry an `--if-match` and the
converter published unconditionally, but the converter now writes conditionally
too and the two writers of this one object must agree on how the ETag is read
and sent back or the condition protecting them from each other is decorative.

Safety design
-------------
* Dry-run by default. Nothing is deleted or rewritten without `--execute`.
* Targets are DERIVED from the published `index.json`, never from a path
  pattern alone (`select_purge_candidates`), then CONFIRMED against S3 --
  object count and total bytes -- before anything is deleted (`stat_prefix`).
  An index entry with zero matching S3 objects is reported as
  `already_absent`, not silently skipped or silently deleted twice: it
  usually just means an earlier, partial `--execute` run already removed it
  (this tool is idempotent and safe to re-run), but it could also mean the
  index is stale, so it is always visible in the report either way.
  This required a fix to hold: `aws s3 ls` exits 1 for a prefix matching zero
  keys, so every already-absent store used to raise and be filed as an error
  instead, which also meant its index entry could never be dropped. See
  `interpret_s3_ls_result`.
* Only ever `<dataset_id>/zarr/...`. Every computed delete target is
  re-validated, a second and independent time, immediately before the delete
  call itself (`assert_within_zarr_prefix`) -- `safe_store_prefix` already
  rejects an unsafe `zarr` rel-path (path traversal, an absolute path, an
  empty segment) when the prefix is first built in `prepare_targets`; the
  second check exists so a future refactor that calls `_rm_recursive` on a
  prefix built a different way still trips a guard before it can escape this
  dataset's own zarr tree.
* A store is only ~/`sub-*/` (raw) or excluded (derivatives/sourcedata/code,
  or a reserved BIDS calibration filename) by construction of
  `is_excluded_from_discovery` -- imported unmodified from `generate_zarr.py`
  -- so a raw store's `zarr` rel-path can never satisfy `select_purge_
  candidates`. A hand-edited or corrupted index entry whose `path` and `zarr`
  disagree on that question is routed to `anomalies` and never purged.
* `index.json` is rewritten (`rewrite_index`) to drop purged store entries and
  any `failures` entries for the same paths, preserving every other top-level
  field and every remaining entry's content and relative order untouched.
* `--from-index-snapshot DIR` reads the store list from a SAVED `index.json`
  rather than the live one, for stores stranded in S3 after a converter rebuild
  stopped listing them (the raw-only change in #98 makes a rebuilt index omit
  them, which puts them beyond the reach of every index-derived target). It
  widens where the store list is read from, NOT what may be deleted: selection
  still runs `is_excluded_from_discovery`, so a raw path is unselectable from
  any document; `safe_store_prefix` and `assert_within_zarr_prefix` still pin
  each delete inside the dataset's own `zarr/` tree; and every target is still
  confirmed against S3 before deletion. The snapshot is validated as a
  `nemar-zarr-index` for that exact `dataset_id` (`load_snapshot_index`), and
  the index rewrite is computed from the LIVE document and skipped when it does
  not list the purged stores (`plan_live_index_rewrite`) -- publishing the
  snapshot itself would restore the very entries being cleaned up.
* The index rewrite is a CONDITIONAL write. The live document is re-read (with
  its ETag) immediately before the write, the rewrite is recomputed from it, and
  the PUT carries `--if-match`, so a converter run that published a new index
  while this one was deleting cannot be silently rolled back: the conflict is
  reported for that dataset (`index_rewrite_conflict`) and the newer document is
  left alone.
* The ordering (delete before index rewrite, always exactly once) and
  error-isolation decisions (an errored target's index entry always
  survives; an already-absent one is folded in without a second delete
  attempt) are pure, data-in/data-out functions -- `plan_dataset_operations`,
  `decide_target_action`, `summarize_target_outcomes` -- not implicit facts
  about `purge_dataset`'s control flow. `purge_dataset` itself is a thin
  walk over the plan those return.
* Every pure function above -- selection, the escape guard, index rewriting,
  S3-listing-output parsing, and the plan/decision/summary trio -- is unit
  tested directly, with no mocking of business logic, in
  `test_purge_non_raw_stores.py`. The actual S3 list/delete/read/write calls
  themselves (`stat_prefix`'s and `_execute_target_step`'s subprocess/S3
  calls, `discover_excluded_stores`, `write_index`, `list_dataset_ids`) are
  thin I/O wrappers around that tested logic and are NOT exercised by the
  automated test suite here -- see the PR description for exactly what that
  leaves unverified.

    `aws s3 ls --recursive --summarize` **exits 1 for a prefix that matches zero
    keys**, while still printing a well-formed `Total Objects: 0` summary and
    writing nothing to stderr. That is a real answer -- the store is already
    gone -- not a failure.

    Treating every non-zero exit as an error made the `already_absent` outcome
    unreachable in practice, which was not merely a reporting wart. An errored
    target is excluded from `purged_rels` by design (never drop the index entry
    of a store we are unsure about), so a store deleted by a run whose index
    rewrite did not complete would be re-statted on the next run, raise, be
    classed as an error, and keep its index entry -- permanently, across any
    number of re-runs. The published index would go on advertising stores that
    return 404. Observed on `nm000172`: 23 stores deleted, index rewrite lost to
    an expired session, and every subsequent run reported 23 "delete errors"
    while being unable to ever finish the job.

    The discriminator is the summary itself: a credential, permission, or
    network failure produces no `Total Objects` line, so it still returns None
    and still raises upstream.
