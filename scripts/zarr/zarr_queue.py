"""Persistent SQLite conversion queue for the NEMAR Hallu zarr cron (epic #684).

The Hallu cron drives Zarr conversion off this queue instead of re-deriving work
each run, so a long backfill (hundreds of datasets) drains gracefully, failures
retry with backoff, and the whole thing is **crash-safe**: the queue lives on
disk (WAL SQLite), and `reconcile` resets any `inprogress` job left behind by a
killed/rebooted run back to `pending`. As long as the machine is on, the cron
fires and the queue picks up exactly where it left off.

One row per dataset:
    jobs(dataset_id PK, latest_version, converted_version,
         status,            -- pending | inprogress | done | failed | data_failed
         attempts, last_error, next_retry_at (epoch),
         enqueued_at (ISO), updated_at (epoch))

`failed` is an INFRA failure that exhausted its bounded retries (transient: a
crashed worker / S3 blip — could be re-tried manually). `data_failed` is a
deterministic DATA failure (a recording biosigIO can't read, e.g. a MaxShield
MEG `.fif`); it fails identically every run, so it is terminal immediately and
is NOT re-queued by reconcile until a genuinely new dataset version appears
(nemarOrg/nemar-cli#774 — previously every reconcile re-queued failed rows from
scratch, which wedged the queue on a single unconvertible dataset).

Subcommands (all take --db):
    reconcile --api-base URL [--stale-seconds N]
        Pull GET /datasets, enqueue (status=pending) every public nm/on dataset
        whose latest_version != converted_version, reset stale `inprogress` rows
        to `pending`, and park rows the catalog no longer lists as `unlisted`
        (withdrawn or returned to private -- see `reconcile`). Idempotent.
    next [--max-attempts N]
        Atomically claim the oldest eligible job -> `inprogress`; print
        "<dataset_id>\t<latest_version>" (nothing if the queue is drained).
    done DATASET VERSION         mark converted at VERSION.
    fail DATASET "ERROR" [--max-attempts N] [--backoff-base S]
        attempts++; reschedule (pending + next_retry_at) until max-attempts, then
        terminal `failed`.
    stats                        counts by status (+ a few recent failures).

    """Enqueue datasets needing (re)conversion + recover stale inprogress rows.

    `datasets` is a list of (dataset_id, latest_version). A dataset is enqueued
    `pending` when it is new or its latest_version differs from the version we
    last converted. A row already `done`/`failed` at the same latest_version is
    left alone (a new version flips it back to pending). `inprogress` rows whose
    `updated_at` is older than `stale_seconds` are assumed crashed and reset to
    `pending` so they run again.

    `listing_complete` enables the `unlisted` sweep: a row for a dataset the
    catalog no longer lists is parked as `unlisted` so `claim_next` stops handing
    it out. Withdrawal is the case that motivated this (#1048) -- ten withdrawn
    datasets sat `pending` forever, each run cloning them, failing on content
    that is 0-byte by design, and writing failure lines that made the conversion
    log look worse than it was. A dataset merely returned to private looks
    identical from here, which is why the status says `unlisted` rather than
    `withdrawn`: absence from the public catalog is all this process can observe.

    The sweep is gated because it is the one destructive thing reconcile does.
    A short read from a paginated catalog fetch would otherwise unlist the whole
    queue, so the caller must have verified it saw every page (see
    :func:`fetch_public_datasets`). Parking rather than deleting keeps
    `converted_version` intact, and a dataset that reappears in the catalog goes
    straight back to `pending` below.

    `failed` means the retry budget ran out on INFRA errors. Most of that budget
    was spent on OOM-killed workers taking whole datasets down with them

    longer exists rather than by anything about the dataset.

    `data_failed` is terminal-by-design for typed DATA failures, but the
    classifier itself was wrong: a runtime out-of-memory used to be recorded as
    `recording_too_large`, a permanent property of the recording, when it is
    really a property of what else was running (#1111). Datasets buried by that
    misclassification are indistinguishable here from genuine ones, so requeue
    them and let the corrected classifier re-decide -- a genuine data failure
