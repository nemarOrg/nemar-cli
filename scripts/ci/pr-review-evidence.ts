/**
 * What a pull request changed, read as git data (ADR 0092).
 *
 * Runs inside the central review workflow against a repository made with `git init` and
 * `git fetch`, which has no working tree. **Nothing is checked out and nothing from the pull
 * request is executed**: with no working tree, no hook, filter, `.gitattributes` driver or script
 * in the pull request can run, and a fork's content is read exactly like a branch's. Every git
 * call passes its arguments as an array (no shell) after the commit ids have been checked against
 * a 40-hex shape, and with `--literal-pathspecs`, so a path or a branch name is only ever data and
 * a file named like a pathspec (`:(glob)*.json`) cannot make git read another file's content.
 *
 * The output has two halves with different trust. {@link buildEvidence} is the deterministic
 * account (counts per area, versions, subjects, a file list) that goes into the report whatever
 * the model says. {@link GitFacts} also carries the text the model is shown (patches, commit
 * subjects), all of it attacker-controlled and handled as such by `pr-review-prompt.ts`.
 *
 * **What the reviewer was NOT shown is a fact too.** The model sees the diff of the changed
 * metadata files that fit a budget, never recordings. A file it needs to read to rule out a loss
 * (a MODIFIED or REMOVED metadata file) that it was not shown in full makes the evidence
 * `truncated`, which stops a clean pass about nothing being lost. An unread ADDED file does not:
 * a new file cannot remove anything.
