/**
 * Remove identifier-named keys from the `attributes` of a Zarr `zarr.json`, editing the TEXT.
 *
 * The root group of every Zarr store the pipeline writes carries the recording's header fields
 * (`attributes.recording_metadata.patientcode`, `.birthdate`, `.technician`, ...), so the serving
 * copy repeats what the scrub removes from the EDF. Two rules decide which members go, and both
 * live here so that what the zarr stage removes, what it re-reads to prove, and what the public
 * check after publication looks for are one rule ({@link zarrIdentifierCount}):
 *
 *  - every key the scanner calls an identifier (`scanJsonKeys` in `shared/identifier-scan.ts`);
 *  - every member that mirrors an EDF identification field ({@link EDF_MIRROR_MEMBERS}).
 *
 * Why text and not parse-and-stringify: a re-serialized document changes more than the keys it
 * was asked to drop. `1.0` becomes `1`, an integer past 2^53 loses digits, `é` becomes `é`,
 * key order and indentation change, and a Zarr reader of that file would be reading something
 * nobody reviewed. Here every byte outside the removed members is the original byte: a scanner
 * walks the text once, records where each member of each object starts and ends, and the removed
 * members (with the one comma that joined them to their neighbor) are cut from the string.
 *
 * Nothing here ever returns, logs or throws a value from the document: errors are fixed words.
 */

/**
 * THE PRINCIPLE behind this list and {@link KNOWN_BENIGN} (maintainer decision, 2026-10-05):
 *
 * **A Zarr store holds the DATA and the EVENTS, plus channel names, types and units and
 * technical recording metadata. It says nothing about the SUBJECT. Subject and phenotype
 * information (age, sex or gender, patient code, birth date, name, additional patient text)
 * lives at DATASET scope; `participants.tsv` is the one canonical place for it, and agents and
 * people go there.** Operator and administrative free text copied from a recording header
 * (technician, administrative code, equipment, additional recording text) is not data, events or
 * channels either.
 *
 * So the members removed from a store are every subject field the converter mirrors from the
 * EDF/BDF patient identification, plus the operator and administrative free text from the
 * recording identification (this set), plus anything the scanner calls an identifier. And the
 * members a store's recording metadata may keep are exactly the technical ones
 * ({@link KNOWN_BENIGN}); any other name is refused until a person has looked at it and named it
 * with `--allow-member`, because a name nobody listed may hold header text.
 *
 * The EDF identification fields the converter copies into a store's root attributes, in the
 * scanner's canonical spelling (lowercase, no spaces, underscores or hyphens), so `patient_name`,
 * `PatientName` and `patient-name` are one name.
 *
 * Where they come from: biosigio's EDF importer (`biosigio/importers/edf.py`,
 * `_extract_metadata`) reads pyedflib's header dict into `recording_info` as `patientcode`,
 * `gender`, `birthdate`, `patient_name`, `patient_additional`, `admincode`, `technician`,
 * `equipment` and `recording_additional` (and `startdate`), then sets every non-empty one on the
 * recording's metadata, which the Zarr exporter writes as `attributes.recording_metadata`. The
 * converter in `scripts/zarr/` adds no spelling of its own. `equipment` is free text copied from
 * the header's recording field: not data, events or channels.
 *
 * `gender` is removed too (decision 2026-10-05): the scrubbed header's patient field is
 * `X X X X` (code, sex, birth date and name all unknown), and the store must say no more than the
 * header does; participants.tsv keeps sex.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-10-05 (names only): every one of nm000186's 88 store roots holds
 * `patientcode`, `birthdate`, `gender` and `equipment`, non-empty, and none of the other five;
 * nm000348's 153 hold none of them.
