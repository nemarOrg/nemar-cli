/**
 * `nemar admin publish`: the publication workflow, from the administrator's side.
 *
 *   nemar admin publish list [--status <s>]    the publication requests, with the identifier screen
 *   nemar admin publish show <ds>              the automated review of one request (admin-publish-review.ts)
 *   nemar admin publish start <ds> | --all     start the automated review (admin-publish-review.ts)
 *   nemar admin publish next                   the requests that need you, one card each (admin-publish-next.ts)
 *   nemar admin publish approve <ds>           approve and publish (admin-publish-approve.ts)
 *   nemar admin publish deny <ds> [-r <why>]   deny one, mailing the depositor the reason
 *   nemar admin publish screen <ds>            run the identifier screen of a request again
 *
 * Split out of `admin.ts` (epic #1726, phase 2) so the publication review's commands do not grow
 * a file of ten thousand lines. The group is registered on `adminCommand` at the position it
 * always had, so `nemar admin --help` is unchanged. `show` and `start` are registered from their own
 * file right after `list`, and `approve` and `next` after `screen`; commander lists a group's
 * subcommands alphabetically, so the order of registration does not show in `--help`.

Description:
  List all publication requests from users, with optional filtering by status.
  Shows dataset ID, status, requesting user, the identifier screen and the
  automated review of each (ADR 0102): its outcome, then the reasons it is not a
  pass, as codes. 'nemar admin publish show <dataset>' says what each one means.

  A * marks a request you can act on now: one waiting for your decision (unless
  it is only waiting for the screen or the review to report), or an approval that
  stopped and can be resumed. It is not marked when it is blocked (the depositor
  acts) or an approval is running.

Filter Options:
  requested  - Pending requests awaiting admin action
  approving  - Currently being processed by orchestrator
  blocked    - Held until the depositor fixes something and requests again
  published  - Successfully published datasets
  denied     - Denied requests with reasons

  --needs-me keeps only the requests marked *, after any --status filter.
  --json prints the response (with --needs-me, the rows it keeps) and nothing else
  on standard output; errors go to standard error.

Examples:
  $ nemar admin publish list                # All requests
  $ nemar admin publish list --status requested   # Pending only
  $ nemar admin publish list --needs-me     # What is yours to act on
  $ nemar admin publish list --status approving   # In progress
  $ nemar admin publish list --status denied      # View denied`,

Description:
  Deny a user's publication request with a specific reason.
  The user will receive an email notification with your reason.

  A clear, actionable reason helps users understand what to fix
  before resubmitting their publication request.

  A request cannot be denied while an approval of it is running, or once an
  approval has run a step that publishes (the dataset may be public): wait for
  the run to end. After a step has published, check the dataset: a blocked
  request waits for its depositor to fix what blocked it; for any other, check
  whether approving it again can finish it, or repair it by hand.

Requirements:
  - Must provide a reason for denial: --reason or, with no --reason, one typed
    at a terminal or the first line of piped input (in a script, pass --reason)
  - Reason will be sent to the user via email
  - User can fix issues and submit a new request

Examples:
  $ nemar admin publish deny nm000104 --reason "BIDS validation failing"
  $ nemar admin publish deny nm000104 -r "Dataset incomplete - missing subjects"
  $ nemar admin publish deny nm000104    # Prompts for reason interactively`,
