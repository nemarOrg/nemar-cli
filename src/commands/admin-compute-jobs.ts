/**
 * `nemar admin compute jobs`: an administrator's commands on compute jobs (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010, and
 * phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118).
 *
 *   nemar admin compute jobs cancel <id>    cancel a job: at Tapis, or here for a job that never started
 *   nemar admin compute jobs advance <id>   one step: submit a `created` job, or read a submitted one
 *                                           back from Tapis, or give a finished one what it is owed
 *   nemar admin compute jobs list           jobs by flag, state and account; `--unmatched` lists
 *                                           Expanse's rows that no job claims
 *   nemar admin compute jobs record <ref>   one job by NEMAR id, Tapis uuid or Slurm id; with
 *                                           `--identity` or `--spec` and `--reason`, the owner's read
 *   nemar admin compute jobs report         one account's jobs and charge in a date range (`--csv`)
 *   nemar admin compute jobs access-report  a quarter's distinct gateway users and jobs (`--csv`)
 *   nemar admin compute jobs hold|release-hold|holds   legal holds on `job:<id>` or `account:<id>`
 *   nemar admin compute jobs access-reports  ACCESS report rows, `failed` ones by their fixed word
 *   nemar admin compute jobs requeue-access-report <job id> --confirmed-not-recorded   (owner only)
 *
 * `advance` is how a job moves in development, where no compute cron runs. Both call the same code the
 * Worker's webhook, its 30-minute tick and a person's own cancel run. They print the job as the Worker
 * shows it to an administrator: fixed words, numbers and times, the four flags, and `platform failure`,
 * an information flag that says NEMAR caused the failure so that it can be compensated by a manual grant
 * (nothing is refunded automatically). Never an identity, a specification, a token or a log.
 *
 * A job id is `job_` and 24 lowercase hexadecimal digits, checked before anything is sent. Every command
 * takes `--json` (standard output stays pure JSON) and exits 1 on any failure.

that has already ended, other than cancelled, is refused.

development, where no compute cron runs. It does what the webhook and the 30-minute tick do, and no more.

The submit is refused while compute is switched off: a created job stays created (the answer is
"waiting", with submit compute_disabled), and everything else, a read-back, a settlement, a copy, still
happens, because a job that is already on a cluster is never stranded by the switch.
