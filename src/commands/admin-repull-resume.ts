const RESUME_HELP = `
Takes a dataset's open re-pull up where it stopped, past its open pull request, on this machine
with your own GitHub token (GH_TOKEN, else \`gh auth token\`). It never merges.

  pr_open      reads the pull request: one found merged is recorded (the Worker reads it on
               GitHub), one closed unmerged ends the record abandoned; a head moved by
               enrichment is recorded, any other is refused (head-foreign). NEMAR's main must be
               the base or have moved by enrichment only; when it moved and GitHub reports the
               pull request dirty or behind, or enrichment changed a path outside .nemar/ and
               .github/, the commit is made again on the new main and pushed with a lease (asked
               first unless --yes). Then the identifier screen of the head is
               dispatched (when none exists or it produced no verdict), and once it passes and
               GitHub reports the pull request clean, the gates are recorded: gates_clear. On a
               re-pull you opened, unstable because BIDS validation failed and no other check
               or status fails is recorded too (both read with your token), and that pull
               request merges with --bids-failure-reason, or without it once the validation
               passes.
  gates_clear  a held claim to merge is resolved from GitHub: a merge is recorded, and a claim
               GitHub says did not merge expires once it is 30 minutes old. A main enrichment
               moved outside .nemar/ and .github/ since the gates (the merge refuses it,
               merge-main-moved) takes the record back to pr_open, where the commit is made again.
  merged       the merge commit GitHub wrote must end with the re-pull commit's two trailers;
               then it waits for the tag v<N.0.0> and the version row (its DOI), compares the
               tagged tree with the re-pull's commit, and records the release (the Worker reads
               the tag and the version row itself). N.0.1's tagged tree must be its gated head
               outside .nemar/ and .github/ (patch-tree-mismatch otherwise): read the difference,
               then --accept-tag-tree "<reason>" records the release.
  released     locks the objects the copy and the uploads wrote (and no other object under the
               dataset's prefix), with the ambient AWS credentials reading the staging manifest
               that lists them; only once every one is locked is the count recorded. Then:
               with no correction and no conflict in the plan, the record is complete; with
               conflicts, it waits for your decision (--take-ours, --keep-upstream: a conflict
               you do not name stays on upstream's side only with --keep-upstream); otherwise
               N.0.1 is made from the reviewed plan (--plan, else the plan's default path):
               NEMAR's side of each correction, and of each conflict you resolved to it,
               replayed onto the new main (nothing is scrubbed or copied), release/v<N.0.1>
               pushed and its pull request opened (asked first unless --yes): patch_synthesized.
  patch_*      N.0.1's pull request takes the same steps as N.0.0's (the screen, the gates, the
               release), and the record is complete once v<N.0.1> is released.

A screen that asks for a person is acknowledged with --acknowledge-identifier-screen "<reason>",
after you read it with \`nemar admin repull status <id>\`; a direct identifier cannot be.
A conflict is named as the plan names it: a path, or dataset_description.json#<Key> for one key
of the description. The README family is replayed as a unit.

Exit codes:
  0  ready to merge (gates_clear, patch_gates_clear), complete, or released with a record that
     does not say how many corrections and conflicts its plan has (it is not completed, and it
     blocks the dataset's next re-pull until \`nemar admin repull abandon <id>\` ends it).
  3  waiting (for the screen, GitHub, a person, your decision on conflicts) after
     --wait-minutes, or stopped with why recorded on the record; run resume again.
  1  refused before anything was written, nothing to resume, or the record ended (abandoned,
     patch_declined).

${AUTOMATIC_HELP} With it, resume is a finish: it takes up only the automatic re-pull
its dispatch names, only once it has merged, and walks it to complete.`;
