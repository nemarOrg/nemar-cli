/**
 * `nemar admin compute runners`: the owner registers, lists and revokes the machines that run jobs for
 * NEMAR (portable compute, card DM-05; protocol `nemar.runner.v1`).
 *
 *   nemar admin compute runners register <name> --pool --cores --memory-mb --scratch-gb --runtime ...
 *   nemar admin compute runners list [--json]
 *   nemar admin compute runners revoke <id> [--json]
 *
 * All three are the owner's. Every command exits 1 on any failure and keeps standard output pure JSON
 * under `--json`. A registration is accounted `none` (runner-reported usage); `su` is not built yet.
 *
 * THE SECRET IS SHOWN ONCE. `register` prints it and the Worker keeps only its hash, so a lost secret is
 * a revoked registration and a new one. It is the only thing a runner needs to start: keep it in a file
 * only you can read (mode 0600), never in a command line, a repository or a chat.

Registers a runner and prints its SECRET, which is shown ONCE: NEMAR keeps only a hash, so a lost secret

  <name>                a fixed word for this registration (lowercase letters, digits, underscore, up to 64);
                        unique among registrations that are not revoked
  --pool <cpu|gpu>      the pool its jobs are counted in
  --cores <n>           whole cores it offers (1 to 256)
  --memory-mb <n>       memory it offers, in MB (1 to 16777216)
  --gpus <n>            GPUs it offers (0 to 8; default 0)
  --scratch-gb <n>      scratch space it offers, in GB (1 to 100000)

The registration is accounted by the runner's own measurements; accounting in service units is not built.
Nothing runs until the owner also turns the runners switch on. The registration is audited.

Owner only. --json prints the Worker's answer as it is, the secret included.

Exit codes:
  0  registered; the id and the secret were printed.
  1  an option was not valid (nothing was sent), the Worker refused (you are not an owner, or a live
     registration has that name) or the write failed.`;

const LIST_HELP = `
Lists every registration, newest first: its id, name, capacity, where it runs, when it was last seen and
whether it was revoked. It never shows a secret or a hash.

Owner only. --json prints the Worker's answer as it is.

Exit codes:
  0  listed.
  1  the Worker refused (you are not an owner) or the read failed.`;

const REVOKE_HELP = `
Ends a registration, in one step: its access tokens stop working at once, its unstarted claims are
released for another runner, and its started jobs are marked unreported with no lease, so neither the
lease nor the job token of the dead runner can land outputs. The runner learns of it when its next call
is refused. Revoking a registration that is already revoked changes nothing and says so.

Owner only. --json prints the Worker's answer as it is.

Exit codes:
  0  revoked, or already revoked.
  1  the id is not a runner id (nothing was sent), the Worker refused (you are not an owner, or there is
     no such runner) or the write failed.`;
