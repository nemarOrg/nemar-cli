/**
 * Authentication commands for NEMAR CLI

 * Commands:
 * - nemar auth login     - Authenticate with API key
 * - nemar auth signup    - Register new account
 * - nemar auth status    - Check authentication status
 * - nemar auth whoami    - Alias for status (common pattern)
 * - nemar auth logout    - Clear stored credentials
 * - nemar auth request-upload-access - Ask an admin for upload access
 * - nemar auth switch    - Switch between stored accounts
 * - nemar auth setup-ssh - Configure SSH for GitHub (optional, gh CLI preferred)
 *
 * Note: The two-prong structure (nemar auth <cmd>) follows CLI best practices
 * for discoverability and organization. Root-level shortcuts (nemar login,
 * nemar whoami, etc.) are provided as convenience aliases in index.ts.

Description:
  Manage your NEMAR account authentication. New users sign in with their
  browser (ORCID creates the account); that activates it (browse, download,
  API key, sandbox training). Uploading datasets additionally needs upload
  access, a one-time admin approval 'nemar auth signup' requests for you
  once your profile is complete.

Workflow:
  1. nemar auth signup   - Browser sign-in; ORCID creates the account, then
                            a few questions for whatever is still missing
  2. Verify your email   - Click the link NEMAR sends you
  3. nemar sandbox        - Complete sandbox training before your first upload

Keys:
  Every browser-based 'nemar auth login' names a key for the machine it
  runs on (list/create/revoke the whole set with 'nemar auth keys'); the
  -k/--key or NEMAR_API_KEY path stores the key you paste and mints
  nothing new. 'retrieve-key' and 'regenerate-key' still work for a
  password-era account but are deprecated; 'nemar auth login' is the
  replacement for both.

Examples:
  $ nemar auth signup                    # Sign in with your browser; complete your profile
  $ nemar auth login                     # Sign in with your browser
  $ nemar auth login -k <api-key>        # Paste an existing key instead
  $ nemar auth keys                      # List this account's named keys
  $ nemar auth status --refresh          # Check authentication status
  $ nemar auth whoami                    # Alias for status
  $ nemar auth switch                    # Switch between accounts
  $ nemar auth logout                    # Clear active account
  $ nemar auth logout --all              # Clear all accounts`,
);

/**
 * Decide how `nemar auth login` should treat a credential already on disk.
 *
 * The gate used to be `isAuthenticated()` alone, which only answers "is *a*
 * key string stored?" — true even when that key was revoked or expired
 * server-side (e.g. after `nemar auth regenerate-key` was run elsewhere).
 * That made the CLI announce "Already logged in" and ask "different account?"
 * when the user actually just needed to re-enter a renewed key for the SAME
 * account (#851). We probe the stored key's liveness and branch on the result.

 * from a previous device login on this same machine.
 *
 * `oldKeyKnownDead` comes from the preflight probe this action already ran:

 * still attempted (best-effort; a repeat revoke of an already-gone row is
 * harmless), but the "(replaced...)" confirmation line is skipped -- there
 * is nothing meaningfully replaced about a key that was already dead.
 *
 * If `upsertAccount` itself throws (a corrupt store, an unwritable config
 * dir), the sign-in already succeeded server-side -- a device login already
 * minted a real, live key -- so nothing landed on disk is worse than the
 * save failure alone. Caught below: a `"device"` key is best-effort revoked
 * with ITSELF as bearer (`revokeApiKeyWithBearer`, since nothing was ever
 * stored to authenticate the ordinary way), and the failure is reported
 * with exit 1 rather than propagating as an uncaught exception.

  Uploading datasets needs upload access: a one-time grant an admin makes

  Before asking, your account needs a username, your given and family name,
  a GitHub username that exists, and your city and country. Set them in
  Settings on nemar.org; the request tells you which ones are missing.

  Asking twice does nothing: while a request is open the command reports
  that and no second message reaches the admins.

Description:
  Prints the identifiers on your account — username, name, email, GitHub
  username, ORCID iD — with the verification state of the email and the
  ORCID link, your access tier, and whether upload access has been granted.

  Always fetched from the server, never from the local config cache: this is
  the command you run before changing something, so a stale answer is worse
  than no answer.

  Each of the ORCID iD, the email address, and the GitHub username backs at
  most one NEMAR account. A second sign-up with any of them is refused rather
  than creating a duplicate; the fix is to change the identifier on the
  account that already holds it.

Subcommands (the same changes Settings on nemar.org makes):
  set-email <address>     mail a code to a new address, then verify-email
  verify-email <code>     finish the change
  set-username <name>     set your NEMAR handle (locked once approved)
  set-name                --given / --family (ORCID wins when a verified iD is linked)
  set-github <handle>     set the GitHub username (checked against GitHub)
  set-location            --city / --country
  orcid link|relink|unlink   opens a browser for ORCID's consent screen

Description:
  ORCID stays a browser flow: the consent screen is ORCID's, and no NEMAR
  command should ever ask for an ORCID password. This mints a short-lived link
  for THIS account, opens it if it can, and then waits for the iD to appear.

  link     attach an ORCID iD to an account that has none
  relink   replace the linked iD with a different one
  unlink   remove the link (and the iD this account claims)

  An iD backs at most one NEMAR account. If it is already linked elsewhere,
  unlink it there first.

  The link URL is printed whether or not a browser opens, so a headless or
  remote machine is a copy-and-paste rather than a dead end. Pass --no-open,
  or set NEMAR_NO_BROWSER=1, to stop the CLI reaching for a browser at all.

  Opening the link shows a NEMAR page naming the account it will link to
  before it sends you to ORCID. If that account is not yours, close the tab:
  the link was made by somebody else and would attach YOUR iD to THEIR
  account. A link can only be used once.

  --timeout is a whole number of seconds (default 300); the wait stops early
  if your credentials stop working or the API becomes unreachable.

Examples:
  $ nemar auth profile orcid link
  $ nemar auth profile orcid relink --no-open
  $ nemar auth profile orcid unlink --yes`,
);
