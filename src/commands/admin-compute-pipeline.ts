/**
 * `nemar admin compute pipeline`: an administrator runs NEMAR's own processing recipes through the compute
 * gateway and reads the stamps they leave (epic #2005 phase A6, #2011; ADR 0118; design section 10).
 *
 *   nemar admin compute pipeline run <recipe> --dataset <id>[@version] [--executor tapis|runner] [--dry-run]
 *   nemar admin compute pipeline run <recipe> --eligible [--limit <n>] [--dry-run]
 *   nemar admin compute pipeline status [--recipe <name>] [--dataset <id>] [--state <state>] [--limit <n>]
 *
 * A run names a recipe and then ONE dataset (with an optional version) or the queue of eligible datasets
 * with a limit. Every run, whoever asks, is bounded by the owner's live and daily caps and by
 * `COMPUTE_PIPELINE_RUN_PER_INVOCATION` per invocation (issue #2121); the answer's `room` says which
 * one it was. It names nothing else: the dataset row (and with it eligibility), the version row, the
 * service account, the pool and the runtime image are the Worker's. `--dry-run` reads only and works against
 * every Worker, including a development one with compute off. A live run is refused by the Worker unless
 * compute is switched on. Every command takes `--json` (standard output stays pure JSON) and exits 1 on any
 * failure; a refused dataset exits 1 with the Worker's word.

                            ${COMPUTE_PIPELINE_RUN_LIMIT_DEFAULT}, at most ${COMPUTE_PIPELINE_RUN_LIMIT_MAX}); a run is also
                            bounded by the live cap of the pool, the daily cap and at most
                            ${COMPUTE_PIPELINE_RUN_PER_INVOCATION} per invocation, and says which one bounded it
  --executor <who>          tapis (the default) or runner. A recipe lists the executors it may be run
                            on (nemar-floor on tapis, nemar-floor-zarr on a runner) and the Worker refuses
                            another with invalid_body naming executor. A runner run names one dataset
                            (not --eligible), needs the runners switch (runners_disabled when it is off),
                            makes a job with no hold and no service units that a registered runner pulls,
                            and is bounded only by the owner's live cap for runners (over_concurrency),
                            never by the daily cap or the tenant ceiling
  --dry-run                 read only: the datasets it would run, the estimated SU (none for a runner),
                            the room (for a runner, the runners' live cap), what a real run lacks, and what
                            blocks the rest; works against every Worker

The caps are the owner's, for every path: a run that finds the pool full or the day's cap used stops
with over_concurrency or daily_cap_reached and dispatches nothing. One named dataset is refused as
over_concurrency when the pool is full; it counts toward the daily cap and is not refused by it.
NEMAR's share of the cluster has a ceiling too: a job that would pass it, or take slots kept for
people or partners, is refused as platform_busy, which stops a run (try again shortly). A run is
clamped to the room under it (the room line says how many are left and, when it is the smallest,
that the tenant ceiling bounded the run), and a dry run of one named dataset reports it as blocked.

Only a public, non-anonymous, first-published, non-withdrawn dataset with EEG data and at least one
version is eligible; the Worker decides that from its own record, never from this command. A dataset
that has a run in flight or finished for the same recipe version and engine is refused as
live_attempt_exists. A live run is refused as compute_disabled unless compute is switched on.

Admin or owner. --json prints the Worker's answer as it is.

Exit codes:
  0  the run was made, or the dry run answered (a queue run that dispatched nothing is still 0).
  1  the arguments are wrong, the dataset was refused, or the Worker refused or could not be reached.`;
