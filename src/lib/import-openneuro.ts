 * Decide what to do with the imported repo's README file.
 *
 * Rule (from nemarOrg/nemar-cli#642):
 * - If the upstream ships `README` with no extension, rename it to
 *   `README.md` so GitHub renders it. Do NOT modify the content.
 *   Skipped (treated as `kept`) if a `README.md` already exists alongside
 *   — we never clobber an upstream-authored `.md`.
 * - If the upstream ships `README.md`, `README.rst`, `README.txt`, or any
 *   other suffixed variant, leave it alone. We don't second-guess the
 *   upstream author's choice; provenance is also captured in
 *   `.nemar/metadata.json` via `IsDescribedBy` / `IsIdenticalTo`, and the
 *   browser surfaces it from there.
 * - If no README exists at all, write a small provenance-only stub so the
 *   dataset page still has something to render. OpenNeuro datasets
 *   normally ship a README of some form, so this fallback should be rare.
 *
 * When the upstream contains multiple README variants (e.g., both `README`
 * and `README.md`) we prefer the already-suffixed file: leaving it untouched
 * is always safe; renaming the bare `README` over it could destroy
 * authored content.
 *
 * The rule itself is `decideReadme` in `shared/standard-edits/readme.ts`, so the
 * upstream re-pull's planner (ADR 0111) makes the same decision over a git tree;
 * this applies it to the directory. Pure on filesystem state — no git
 * operations, no network. The caller is responsible for staging the returned
 * paths.

  // a recording it writes is readable by key at once. A header that needs a scrub is
  // downloaded, patched, annexed under a new key and uploaded from THIS clone, its
  // old key retired; identifier-keyed JSON values are blanked. It refuses, before the
  // push, anything it cannot read, verify or move.
  //
  // The annex-policy half (ADR 0060), in its own commit:
  //   - files upstream left as git blobs are annexed and their content uploaded
  //     from THIS clone, which is why this cannot move to the copy phase: that
  //     phase is pure S3 and has no clone, and no upstream KEY exists for these
  //     files to be server-side copied by;
  //   - the inherited `annex.largefiles` attributes are replaced by NEMAR's own
  //     expression, which is then read back. A `.gitattributes` setting outranks
  //     the `git annex config` value `configureLargefiles` writes, so leaving them
  //     means every later add follows upstream's rule -- and removing them without
  //     installing ours is worse still, because git-annex with no policy set
  //     annexes everything, metadata included.
  //
  // On a re-import it also carries keys this tree already holds into the manifest,
  // so finalize verifies and registers the ones a previous prepare uploaded.
  //
  // The manifest is then cut to the keys the committed tree names, minus any the
  // git-annex branch records as dead. Built from upstream's whereis, it describes
