 * saves is the content of those files streamed through git-annex filter-process.

 * without it. So the skip is taken only when there is real content to avoid
 * reading, and a small tree saves exactly as it would without the skip.
 *
 * The skip DEFERS the re-read, it does not remove it: the entries stay zero-stat, so
 * the first `git status` afterwards re-reads the annexed content once (0.47 s against
 * 0.03 s at 600 x 120 KB; about 4.5 s at 15,000 files).
 *
 * 1 GiB is a deliberately conservative starting point, not a measured crossover:
