/**
 * One bounded, resumable, size-verified HTTP file downloader.
 *
 * Two paths in this CLI fetch a list of files over plain HTTPS: the NEMAR data
 * plane (`lib/http-download.ts`, for a dataset with no git-annex clone) and
 * OpenNeuro's public S3 bucket (`lib/openneuro.ts`, the fallback when the AWS
 * CLI is absent). They differ only in where the list comes from -- a
 * `manifest.json` document in one case, a `ListObjectsV2` walk in the other --
 * and both then want the same thing: fetch these `n` files into this
 * directory, `c` at a time, without losing the whole transfer to one bad
 * object.
 *
 * That common half lives here, once. Everything a caller has to get right is
 * in this module rather than in each copy:
 *
 *   - **Writes are verified against the declared size.** `Bun.write` returns
 *     the true byte count and does NOT throw on a short body, so a truncated
 *     response, or an intercepting proxy's HTML login page, otherwise lands as
 *     a healthy file and the run reports success in green. A mismatch removes
 *     the file rather than leaving something that satisfies "the file exists".
 *   - **Resume is free.** A file already on disk at its declared size is left
 *     alone and reported as skipped, so an interrupted transfer is re-run with
 *     no flag.
 *   - **Retries with backoff**, because the hosts involved throttle by address
 *     (`raw.githubusercontent.com` serves most of a dataset's metadata
 *     entries), and a single 429 with no retry turns a 20,000-file download
 *     into thousands of permanent failures on a healthy link.
 *   - **Path traversal is refused.** Both file lists are server-supplied, so a
 *     `..` must not be able to write outside the output directory.
 *   - **Transport and disk faults are distinguished from a clean 404**, which
 *     is what lets a caller exit non-zero on a half-finished transfer while
 *     still treating genuinely absent content as a reportable state (ADR
 *     0005).
 *
 * What stays with each caller is what is genuinely theirs: how the list is
 * obtained, how a URL is built, what selection means, and what a partial
 * result should do to the exit code.
