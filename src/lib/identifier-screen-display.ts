/**
 * How the terminal prints a publication request's identifier screen (epic
 * #1610, phase 4).
 *
 * NOTHING IS DERIVED HERE. The backend sends `identifier_screen` as
 * `describeScreen` (shared/identifier-screen-report.ts) worded it: a headline, a
 * tone and count lines. This module owns only colour and indentation, so
 * `nemar dataset publish status`, `nemar admin publish list` and the admin email
 * cannot say different things about one screen.
 *
 * The one thing set apart is the acquisition-date warning (ADR 0090): its lines are
 * recognized by `isDateWarningLine`, which owns the wording, and printed in the
 * warning color instead of the dim of a count line. Which lines they are is not
 * decided here.
