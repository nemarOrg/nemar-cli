/**
 * The single source of truth for what git-annex takes and what stays in plain git.
 *
 * ADR 0015 set the policy; this module owns its one spelling. Before it existed
 * the same rule was written out five times -- `configureLargefiles`, the manifest
 * classifier in `transfer.ts`, `isNeverAnnexedMetadata` in `import-openneuro.ts`,
 * `scripts/nemar-restore-dataset.sh`, and twice more in `https://docs.nemar.org/admin/operations/validated-workflows/`
 * -- in three mutually inconsistent forms. That drift is what let `_motion.tsv`
 * (issue #1158) land in git: the annex expression excluded every `*.tsv`, while
 * the manifest classifier called anything over 100 kB a data file.
 *
 * Two consumers, one rule:
 *   - `buildLargefilesExpression()` renders it as a git-annex preferred-content
 *     expression for `git annex config --set annex.largefiles`.
 *   - `shouldAnnex()` evaluates it in TypeScript for the upload manifest.
 * `test/annex-policy.test.ts` drives both against a real git-annex repo and
 * asserts they agree file-for-file, so a disagreement is a failing test rather
 * than a silent one. The one place they differ ON PURPOSE is letter case: the
 * TypeScript rule folds it and git-annex's globs do not, so a name like `X.EDF` is
 * data to one and not to the other (see {@link isCaseVariantData}).
