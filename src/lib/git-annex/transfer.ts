 *
 *   - Nothing unavailable         -> `complete`. Zero retrieved just means every
 *                                    requested file was already local.
 *   - Transport fault in output   -> `failed`, whatever the tallies. Checked

 *                                    fault can develop mid-run: STS credentials
 *                                    are short-lived (see s3-remote.ts), so a
 *                                    parallel `-J` run over a large dataset can
 *                                    easily land a few files and then 403 on
 *                                    every remaining one. Reading that as
 *                                    `partial` would exit 0 and tell the user
 *                                    the data is missing upstream when in fact
 *                                    a retry would fetch all of it.
 *   - Some retrieved, some not    -> `partial`.
 *   - Nothing retrieved, some not -> `failureText` breaks the tie. This is the
 *                                    ordinary re-run case: on a partially
 *                                    downloaded dataset git-annex silently skips
 *                                    the files already present, so a second
 *                                    `get` retrieves nothing and re-reports the
 *                                    same absent files. Treating that as fatal
 *                                    would make every repeat run exit 1.
 *
 * The tie-break reads git-annex's failure output because that is the only place
 * the distinction survives: "not found" means the archive answered and does not
 * have the object, while denied/expired/connection errors mean we never got a
 * usable answer. An unrecognised failure stays `failed`, so the ambiguous path
 * only ever downgrades to `partial` on positive evidence of absence.
 *
 * `requireComplete` (the CLI's --require-complete) collapses `partial` into
 * `failed` for pipelines that need all-or-nothing semantics.
 *
 * Pure -- no I/O; unit-tested without git-annex.

 * The path-scoped sibling of {@link copyToAnnexRemote}, which copies the whole
 * tree. The import path needs the scoped form (#1159): its clone holds content
 * for the handful of files it just annexed and nothing else, and `copy --to .`
 * would walk every upstream pointer in the dataset to find that out (it skips
 * content-absent files in silence, so the cost is the walk, not the noise).
 *
 * `filesCopied` counts the successful `--json` copy records, which means "the
 * remote has it", not "it was transferred now" -- an already-present key
 * reports success too; `filesSent` counts the ones git-annex actually moved. Both
 * are numbers for the operator, NOT evidence the content arrived: a path git-annex
 * does not consider annexed is skipped silently with exit 0 and simply never
 * appears. A caller that needs proof should ask the location log afterwards
 * (`listAnnexedPaths(path, remote)`). The paths go in argv-safe chunks, each run
 * with `-J jobs`.
