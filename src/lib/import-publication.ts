/**
 * How an import's finalize publishes: it waits for the identifier screen's verdict and approves
 * only a clear one (ADR 0089).
 *
 * Requesting publication starts the screen (ADR 0086), and approval is refused until it reports.
 * The importer used to request and approve in one run, which the gate now refuses. So finalize
 * polls the request's screen state for a bounded time, approves when `screenGate` says `clear`,
 * re-runs a screen the gate calls `stale` at most once (an automated commit to `main`, such as
 * enrichment's, can land after the screen read the head), and otherwise approves nothing.
 *
 * **A held publication is not a failed import.** Every outcome returns, except an approval of a
 * clear screen that fails for a reason that is not the screen's and a hold that cannot be recorded:
 * the data is copied and registered, the request stays open, and Phase 4 mails the admins whatever
 * the screen says, including when it never reports. Exiting non-zero here would quarantine or roll
 * back the import and open a public failure issue for a dataset that needs a person, not a fix
 * (ADR 0053).
 *
 * **The importer's own holds are written on the request.** The screen cannot see that a forward fix
 * left originals in the pushed history, or that the staging manifest has no scrub record, so for
 * those the request is denied with a fixed reason (`IMPORTER_HOLD_REASONS`) before anyone is asked
 * to approve it; publishing then takes a person's new request, which re-runs the screen.
 *
 * **Unknown is never clear.** A status that cannot be read, a screen view an older backend does
 * not send, a state that is not a state, and a wait that runs out are each `unchecked`, never an
 * approval.
