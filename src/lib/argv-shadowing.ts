/**
 * Keep a subcommand's value-taking option from being claimed by an ancestor
 * option of the same name (#1493).
 *
 * The hazard: Commander recognizes an ancestor's options anywhere on the
 * command line unless positional options are enabled, and enabling them would
 * break every global flag typed after the subcommand (`nemar dataset upload
 * ./x --verbose`). The root declares `-v, --version` as a boolean, so in
 * `nemar dataset release nm000104 --version 2.0.0`, the form the release help
 * documents, the root claims `--version`, prints the CLI version and exits 0,
 * and a scripted release (`-y`) silently does nothing. The equals spelling
 * (`--version=2.0.0`) reaches the subcommand, because a boolean does not match
 * `--flag=value`.
 *
 * The rewrite: for the command the line addresses, every option that takes a
 * value and whose long flag an ancestor declares as a BOOLEAN is joined to its
 * value (`--version 2.0.0` -> `--version=2.0.0`). Only the tokens after that
 * command's name are its own. An ancestor option that takes a value itself
 * (`admin recover --recover-file`) needs no join: the ancestor consumes the
 * flag and its value together, and the leaf reads it back through
 * `optsWithGlobals()`.
 *
 * Two shapes are errors, because passing them along lets the root claim the
 * flag, which is the same silent no-op:
 * - A shadowed flag with no value: last token, empty, or followed by a token
 *   that reads as a flag. Commander itself would take ANY next token as the
 *   value of a required option; this deliberately diverges, because a
 *   flag-looking next token (`--version -y`) is far more likely a forgotten
 *   value than a value. A value that really starts with "-" is spelled
 *   `--flag=value`. A lone "-" counts as a value, as it does for Commander.
 * - A shadowed flag typed before the command that declares it (`dataset
 *   --version 2.0.0 release`). At the root it stays the root's own flag:
 *   `nemar --version dataset release ...` still prints the version.
 * Asking for help (`--help` or `-h` before `--`) outranks a missing value; the
 * bare flag is dropped so the root does not print the version instead.
 *
 * The errors are thrown, not printed: the function stays free of output and
 * process.exit so tests can assert on it, and src/index.ts reports them
 * through the declaring command, which makes the stream and exit code
 * Commander's own. The message is rebuilt here because Commander's
 * optionMissingArgument is private and absent from its typings; the tests pin
 * the literal, so an upgrade that changes the wording is noticed.
 *
 * Left alone: anything after `--`, a flag already spelled `--flag=value`, and
 * boolean collisions (#1220, `-v` vs `-v, --verbose`). Not handled:
 * - Short flags. Rewriting cannot rescue one: Commander's combined-short-flag
 *   rule makes the root claim `-vVALUE`. None exists today.
 * - An OPTIONAL-value option (`--flag [value]`) is joined when it has a
 *   value, but without one a bare flag has no spelling the root will not
 *   claim. None exists today; a test pins that.
