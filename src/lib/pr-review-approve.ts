/**
 * Approving a dataset pull request as the administrator themselves (ADR 0093).
 *
 * **Why this runs on the administrator's machine and not in the Worker.** An approval is a person
 * vouching for a change, and GitHub records whose. No Worker code path approves, and the Worker
 * holds nothing that belongs to an individual administrator; the tokens it does hold (the NEMAR App
 * and the datasets token) could submit a review, which is exactly why one must never be made with
 * them: it would put the App's name on a judgment a person made, and turn the automated review
 * (which the App publishes) into its own approval. So the approval is a request from here to
 * GitHub, with the token the administrator already holds, and the only thing the NEMAR API
 * contributes is the automated verdict to show them first.
 *
 * - **The token is checked before it is used.** `GET /user` answers for a person's token and refuses
 *   an App installation token (403), so a CI or bot credential left in `GH_TOKEN` cannot approve "as"
 *   someone. The login it names is also compared with the one the administrator's NEMAR account is
 *   linked to. `gh auth token` is run with `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` removed from its
 *   environment: `gh` itself prefers them to its stored login, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the Actions
 *   bot's in a workflow.
 * - **The approval is pinned to a commit.** It is submitted with `commit_id` set to the head the
 *   administrator was shown, so a push that lands in between leaves the approval on the commit they
 *   read.
 * - **A merge is a client-side check, not enforcement.** It is attempted once, only if GitHub
 *   reports the pull request `clean`; it re-asks for a few seconds while GitHub is still working
 *   the state out, does not wait for pending checks, sends the approved `sha`, and otherwise stops
 *   with the approval standing. An administrator can be a bypass actor on the
 *   ruleset, so this does not attempt a merge GitHub reports as blocked; the ruleset is what
 *   enforces, and it is not this code's job to defeat it.
 * - **A write whose result is not known is said to be unknown.** A request that got no answer, or
 *   an answer that cannot be read, may have been applied; it is reported as `unknown`, never as a
 *   refusal, and so is a 5xx from a gateway in front of GitHub.
