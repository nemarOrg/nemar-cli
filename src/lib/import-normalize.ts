/**
 * Bringing an imported clone onto NEMAR's annex policy.
 *
 * The import deliberately inherits upstream's annex layout -- that is what makes
 * the S3 leg a server-side copy by key -- so it inherits upstream's idea of what
 * counts as data too. OpenNeuro decides by size alone (~1 MB), NEMAR by the
 * policy in `git-annex/policy.ts`, and the gap between the two is what left 675 MB
 * of `_motion.tsv` recordings in a public git repo (#1158). `findUnannexedData`
 * reports that gap; this module closes it, in the two places it has to be closed:
 *
 *   - {@link normalizeUnannexedData} annexes the files already in the clone and
 *     uploads their content, so the tree we push names keys that resolve.
 *   - {@link applyNemarAnnexPolicy} replaces the inherited `annex.largefiles`
 *     attributes with NEMAR's configured expression, because a `.gitattributes`
 *     setting beats both `git annex config` and git config, so until they are
 *     gone every later add keeps following upstream's rule. See ADR 0060.
 *
 * {@link normalizeImportedTree} is the pair of them as the prepare phase performs
 * them, in one commit, and is what `prepareImport` calls.
 *
 * Both run in the prepare phase. It is not the only phase that holds a clone
 * (finalize clones twice), but it is the only one holding a clone before the
 * tree is committed and pushed -- and the copy phase, which does the bulk S3
 * work, holds none at all.
