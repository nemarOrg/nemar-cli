/**
 * Plain-HTTP dataset download: the path that needs no git, no git-annex and
 * no GitHub account.
 *
 * `nemar dataset download` normally clones the dataset repository and pulls
 * annexed content through git-annex. That is the right default -- it yields a
 * working repository with history, and `commit`/`push`/`update` operate on it.
 * It is also the wrong tool for three real cases:
 *
 *   1. git-annex is not installed. Today that is a hard exit, which is a poor
 *      answer to "I just want the files".
 *   2. The repository is not readable by the caller even though the DATA is
 *      public. This is the shape a temporarily-anonymous deposit takes.
 *   3. A machine where installing git-annex is impractical: a container, a
 *      login node, a CI runner.
 *
 * In all three the data plane already serves everything needed. This module
 * reads `<api>/data/<id>/<version>/manifest.json` -- one request that returns
 * every file's path, size, checksum and a direct byte URL -- and fetches the
 * selected entries with a bounded worker pool.
 *
 * **What you get is a snapshot, not a repository.** There is no `.git`, so
 * `nemar dataset commit`, `push` and `update` do not work in the result, and
 * `git annex get` cannot fetch anything that was filtered out. Re-running the
 * download with different filters is how you widen the selection. Callers must
 * say so; `printSnapshotCaveat` is the one wording.
 *
 * The data plane is addressed through the configured API origin's `/data`
 * mount rather than `data.nemar.org`, because that mount exists in every
 * environment (production, staging and the workers.dev dev deployment) while
 * the pretty hostname does not. That fixes which ENVIRONMENT is asked, in one
 * place: whichever API the CLI is already pointed at. It does not fix which
 * host serves the bytes -- those come from each entry's `bytes_url`, which
 * now names the data host for every entry, annexed or git-tracked
 * (nemarOrg/nemar-cli#1403: the Worker serves git-tracked files itself
 * instead of redirecting to raw.githubusercontent.com, which is what lets a
 * dataset with a private repo stay readable). The presigned `url` on each
 * entry is deliberately ignored in favor of `bytes_url`: for an annexed file
 * `url` expires in about an hour, which a long transfer outlives, while
 * `bytes_url` is durable by contract.
