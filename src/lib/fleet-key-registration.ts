/**
 * Re-register annexed content NEMAR holds but never advertised (#1392).
 *
 * `batchSetKeysPresent` used to run fifty `setpresentkey` processes at once and
 * count every exit-0 as a registration. It is fixed, but the datasets it already
 * lied about are still out there: a fleet sweep found 528 of 600 imported
 * datasets with ZERO keys recorded at `nemar-s3`, 720,896 keys in total, every
 * one of them sitting in the bucket.
 *
 * Those datasets are not broken for a user -- an imported repository carries
 * OpenNeuro's `s3-PUBLIC` remote with `autoenable=true`, so `git annex get`
 * still works. What is broken is that NEMAR does not serve its own copy, so
 * every clone goes to upstream and the archive's independence from OpenNeuro is
 * not real.
 *
 * Two rules this module will not bend (ADR 0061):
 *
 *  1. **What the bucket holds is established by listing it, once, with
 *     credentials.** Not by a per-key anonymous HEAD: `s3://nemar` denies
 *     anonymous ListBucket, so S3 answers a missing key with 403 rather than
 *     404, and 403 also means private, expired, or signed without a session
 *     token. One `list-objects-v2` per dataset is both conclusive and cheaper
 *     than 4,177 HEADs.
 *  2. **A dataset the bucket cannot fully account for is left alone.** If any
 *     annexed key has no object, this is not a lost registration, it is content
 *     that was never transferred (#1396), and registering the rest would write
 *     true claims into a repository whose real problem is elsewhere. Reported
 *     and skipped, unless the caller asks otherwise.

/**
 * Run `work` over `items` with at most `limit` in flight, preserving order.
 *
 * Results are written by input index, so the caller gets them in input order
 * however they complete: the `Parts` array a multipart copy hands to
 * `complete-multipart-upload` depends on that.
 *
 * **On a failure it waits for the siblings before rejecting.** There is no
 * cancellation, so the other workers keep running whatever this does; the choice
 * is only whether the caller learns of the failure before or after they stop.
 * Before is worse: the multipart caller's error handler aborts the upload the
 * still-running `upload-part-copy` calls are writing to, and a part that lands
 * after the abort resurrects an upload nobody will ever complete, which is
 * billable storage no object listing can see. The first rejection is still the
 * one thrown, so the reported cause does not change.
