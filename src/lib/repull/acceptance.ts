/**
 * `nemar admin repull resume <id> --accept-merge-trailers "<reason>"`: the acceptance of a re-pull's
 * squash merge made without its trailers (epic #1046; ADR 0111, the amendment of 2026-10-29; issue
 * #1996), as the release step takes it on from `merged` or `patch_merged` (`release.ts`).
 *
 * The merge gate writes the squash message so that its last paragraph is the re-pull commit's
 * trailers, which the privacy ledger's fresh-clone proof (ADR 0085) reads; a merge made with
 * GitHub's own button carries GitHub's message instead, and the release refuses it
 * (`merge-trailers`). Rewriting `main` is no repair, so an administrator may accept the merge, on
 * evidence and never on the reason alone. The release first waits for the tag and the version row,
 * as for any merge, so NEMAR's ledger line never lands on `main` before the tag. Then, before
 * anything is sent, this reads, with the administrator's own token and from NEMAR's origin, in this
 * order; the first that does not hold refuses with its word and nothing is written, not even the
 * step's error:
 *  - the record an administrator opened (`accept-automatic`: the automatic path's merges are the
 *    Worker's, sent with the trailers);
 *  - its pull request on GitHub: from the record's release branch into `main` of the dataset's own
 *    repository (`pr-foreign`), merged, with the record's merge commit (`merge-mismatch`);
 *  - the merge commit: one parent (`merge-not-squash`), the record's base or an enrichment-shaped
 *    descendant of it (`merge-parent-foreign`); the merged head, the recorded head or an
 *    enrichment-shaped descendant of it (`merge-head-foreign`);
 *  - its tree, the record's commit outside `.nemar/**` and `.github/**` (`merge-tree-mismatch`),
 *    the comparison the release makes for the tag (`tagTreeVersus`); N.0.1 needs its gated head
 *    (`tree-anchor-missing`);
 *  - what it did to the privacy ledger: nothing, or scrub lines appended (`merge-ledger-foreign`).
 * It prints what it verified, then the Worker reads all of it again with its own credential, checks
 * that the record is this administrator's, records the acceptance with the reason, and, when the
 * merge appended a `repull-scrubbed` line beside other files, appends the one ledger line that names
 * it to `main`. This reads that line back from origin before the release goes on
 * (`attestation-unseen` otherwise, which the next run takes up: the Worker reads `main` again and
 * writes the line once more when it is not there). A later run finds the acceptance recorded, says
 * so, and goes on with no flag.
 *
 * Exit codes, one rule for the first acceptance and for a later run: a refusal on the evidence, or
 * on what `main` holds, exits 1 (running again changes nothing); a GitHub, a NEMAR API or an origin
 * that could not be read, or a line not yet written or not yet seen, exits 3 (run resume again).
