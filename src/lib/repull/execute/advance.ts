/**
 * Execution past `prepared` (ADR 0111, decisions 2 and 8; epic #1046 phase 6): the copy, the
 * registration, the release branch and its pull request.
 *
 *   S3  `prepared -> copied`: the copy manifest rebuilt from the synthesized commit and the plan,
 *       and its digest compared with the recorded one; the staging manifest written; every key it
 *       copies copied from upstream at its pinned version (`copy.ts`); then every key of the
 *       manifest, copied or uploaded, present at its declared size in a fresh listing;
 *   S4  `copied -> registered`: the tree gate and one registration commit on origin's git-annex
 *       branch, proved from origin (`register.ts`);
 *   S5  `registered -> pr_open`: `main` checked, the release branch pushed or found, the pull
 *       request found or opened with the administrator's token (`pull-request.ts`).
 *
 * Each step runs on the synthesized commit in a working clone that holds it: the one preparation
 * left, or one restored from the checkpoint. Before each, upstream's tag must still be the commit
 * the plan read (`upstream-tag-moved`), because the commit's trailers name it. A step that fails
 * records why on the row with the error prefix of its step (`[copy:`, `[register:`, `[pr:`, never
 * `[prepare:`, which only a preparation clears) and refuses; nothing it did is undone, and the next
 * run checks what is already there before it acts. At `pr_open`, and on any later run that finds
 * the record there, the working directory, which holds the delta's unscrubbed originals in a local
 * commit, is removed unless `--keep-workdir`.
 *
 * Every push and S3 call goes through the write guard (`write-guard.ts`). Execution never merges.
