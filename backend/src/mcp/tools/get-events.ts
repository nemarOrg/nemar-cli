/**
 * `get_events` (epic #1065 phase 3, issue #1295).
 *
 * **Primary path** (`index.events_parquet` present, every v3 index that
 * parsed at least one events.tsv): reads the WHOLE parquet file once with
 * `hyparquet` on a per-store cache miss, groups rows by `store_path` (the
 * producer's own name for the store's `zarr` path --
 * `scripts/zarr/generate_zarr.py`'s `events_schema`), and writes EVERY
 * store's rows (`events/<zarr>`) to the projection cache in one pass -- one
 * dataset-wide
 * parquet read serves every recording's future `get_events` call, not just
 * the one this request named, up to {@link MAX_STORE_FANOUT_ENTRIES}
 * stores. `sample_index` comes back from hyparquet as a
 * `BigInt` (parquet INT64); converted to `Number` here, once, before the
 * value is cached or returned, with a `Number.isSafeInteger` guard -- the
 * whole point of the primary path is that `sample_index` is EXACT, so a
 * value that cannot round-trip through `Number` losslessly must throw, not
 * silently publish a wrong index. `source: "events_parquet"`,
 * `estimated: false` always on this path.
 *
 * **The parquet is the data source whenever the index names one; only the
 * PROJECTION CACHE is gated on a usable `source_commit`.** A dataset can, in
 * principle, have `events_parquet` set but no 40-hex commit to key a cache
 * entry on (the schema does not force one to imply the other); in that case
 * the cache is bypassed -- read fresh every call -- but the parquet is still
 * read, never silently swapped for the strictly-worse `events.tsv` fallback.
 *
 * **Codec: a hand-rolled ZSTD-only `compressors` map, not the
 * `hyparquet-compressors` package.** That package's `compressors` export
 * eagerly constructs its `SNAPPY` entry at module load
 * (`snappyUncompressor()` from the `hysnappy` dependency), which compiles a
 * WASM module synchronously -- `WebAssembly.Module(): Wasm code generation
 * disallowed by embedder`, reproduced under real workerd via `bunx wrangler
 * dev --local` against `mcp-smoke-entry.ts`, the SAME failure class
 * `blosc-decode.ts`'s module doc documents for `numcodecs`. This crashes the
 * WHOLE bundle at isolate startup, for every request, not just a
 * `get_events` call -- unacceptable regardless of whether any dataset's
 * parquet ever uses SNAPPY (none does today: every column in the live
 * nm000329 fixture is ZSTD). So `hyparquet-compressors` was removed from
 * `package.json`, and this file builds the one-entry `compressors` map
 * itself, straight from `fzstd` (the same pure-JS decoder `blosc-decode.ts`
 * already uses) -- functionally identical to what the package would have
 * supplied for ZSTD, with none of its SNAPPY baggage. A dataset whose
 * parquet ever used a codec other than ZSTD would throw here (hyparquet's
 * own error for a missing compressor entry), which is preferable to a
 * bundle that cannot start at all.
 *
 * Deliberately reads every column the parquet file has (no `columns` filter
 * on `parquetReadObjects`) rather than restricting to the eight named
 * fields on `eventRowSchema`: the schema is `.passthrough()` specifically
 * so `subject`/`session`/`task`/`run` (and any `x_`-prefixed extra) reach
 * the caller unchanged, which only holds if this read actually fetches
 * them.
 *
 * **A store the parquet has no rows for** (the converter never found or
 * parsed its events.tsv, distinct from a store with a genuinely empty
 * events.tsv, which is indistinguishable from this on the wire either way)
 * still gets, below the
 * {@link MAX_STORE_FANOUT_ENTRIES} bound, a `[]` cache entry written in the
 * SAME pass as every other store -- so a repeat call for that store is a
 * cache hit, never a re-read of the whole file. Either way the response
 * carries a `note` saying so explicitly rather than a bare empty list a
 * caller could misread as "this recording truly has no events".
 *
 * **Fallback path** (no `events_parquet` -- every v1/v2 index today):
 * derives the sibling `<prefix>_events.tsv` from the recording's `path`
 * (BIDS naming: replace the trailing `_<suffix>.<ext>` with `_events.tsv`)
 * and fetches it credential-free from `raw.githubusercontent.com` via the
 * SAME URL builder the zarr fidelity sweep uses
 * (`rawContentUrl`, `services/zarr-fidelity-sweep.ts`) rather than
 * duplicating it -- `ref` is the resolved 40-hex `source_commit` when
 * usable, else `main`. `sample_index` is computed locally against the
 * chosen group's SERVING `rate`; `source: "events_tsv_fallback"`,
 * `estimated: true` always -- the estimate is off by a sub-sample amount
 * wherever source and target rates are not integer multiples.
 * **Only a clean 404 means absence** (a missing file, OR a private repo,
 * which reads identically to an anonymous GET): that answers `events: []`
 * with a note; BIDS inheritance (walking up to a session/subject/
 * root-level events.tsv) is explicitly out of scope, and the note says so.
 * ANY OTHER non-2xx, or a thrown fetch (a network failure), is an
 * INFRASTRUCTURE failure, not an absence -- it answers a tool error naming
 * the HTTP status (or the thrown message) and the tsv path, and
 * `total_count` never comes from that failure (there is no total_count at
 * all; the call errors outright, mirroring `render_overview`'s
 * chunk-fetch-failure result).
 *
 * Never the data host (`data.nemar.org`): its file branch is a redirect,
 * not something this Worker can read in-process (`routes/data.ts` has no
 * injectable `fetch`).

 * the cache WRITES, not the read that precedes them. The read is the bigger
 * number. Measured 2026-09-09 against the live bucket: 285 public datasets
 * publish an `events.parquet`; 13 are over 5 MB, 6 over 20 MB, and nm000104 is
 * 99,863,763 bytes with 5,411,570 rows across 1131 stores.
 *
 * So `get_events(dataset_id: "nm000104", limit: 1)` -- anonymous, no auth --
 * used to pull 95 MB through the Worker, zstd-decompress it in pure JS,
 * materialize 5.4 M row objects, run 5.4 M zod parses, and only then apply
 * `limit`/`offset`. That cannot fit in a 128 MB isolate, and the failure
 * RE-AMPLIFIES: the isolate dies before `waitUntil` runs, so nothing is cached,
 * so the next attempt repeats the whole read. At the anonymous 500/60s IP
 * bucket that is tens of GB/min of S3 egress from one IP with zero cache
 * progress.
 *
 * Refusing is the right answer rather than paging, because the rows for one
 * store are not addressable without reading the file: `parquetReadObjects` can
 * take `rowStart`/`rowEnd`, but a row's `store_path` is only known after it is
 * read. And refusing costs the caller little: `index.json` publishes
 * `events_parquet` as a PUBLIC URL, so a client that genuinely wants 5.4 M rows
 * can fetch and query the file itself. Handing over a URL instead of streaming
 * bytes is exactly the recipe-first posture ADR 0049 sets for signal data.
 *
 * Both bounds are checked from `parquetMetadataAsync`, which this path already
 * fetches before the full read, so a refusal costs one footer read.
