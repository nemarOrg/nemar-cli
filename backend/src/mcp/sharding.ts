/**
 * Pure Zarr v3 `sharding_indexed` planning for `read_window` taste mode
 * (epic #1065 phase 4, issue #1296).
 *
 * Level 0 of every served store is a SHARDED array: shape `[n_channels,
 * n_samples]`, outer chunk (the "shard") `[n_channels, shard_samples]`,
 * inner chunk (the codec's own `sharding_indexed.configuration.chunk_shape`)
 * `[n_channels, chunk_samples]`, `index_location: "end"`. `shard_samples`/
 * `chunk_samples` are per-STORE properties (read from the specific store's
 * own group entry, `targetGroup.shard_samples` in `read-window.ts` -- never
 * hardcoded or assumed constant across a dataset or group name): verified
 * live on nm000329's `sub-1` store `eeg_250hz` group (shard 75000, chunk
 * 1000) and on003392's `sub-06` store `meg_250hz` group (shard 68000, chunk
 * 1000) -- see `test/fixtures/zarr-array-level0.zarr.json` and
 * `backend/test/fixtures/mcp/nm000329-shard-index-c-0-0.bin`/
 * `nm000329-shard-index-c-0-1.bin` (REAL captured footers, both stores'
 * own shards). A DIFFERENT on003392 store (`sub-01`, the one
 * `test/fixtures/zarr-index-on003392-meg-sss-slice.json` captures) reports
 * `shard_samples: 69000` for the identical group NAME at the identical
 * `source_commit` -- both numbers are real; they are simply two different
 * stores' own values, which is exactly why this code reads the figure per
 * store rather than assuming one number for a whole dataset or group name.
 *
 * An inner chunk always spans every channel, so the chunk grid is always
 * `1 x ceil(n_samples / shard_samples)` and a shard's object key is always
 * `<zarr>/<group>/0/c/0/<j>` -- a taste of one channel still decodes every
 * channel of every inner chunk the window spans. Cost is driven by DURATION
 * (how many inner chunks) and the store's own channel count, never by how
 * many channels the caller asked for.
 *
 * **A shard's footer entry count is CONSTANT across every shard of the
 * array, including the final (boundary) one -- it is `shard_samples /
 * chunk_samples`, full stop, never a function of how many samples actually
 * fall inside that shard.** This was gotten wrong in an earlier version of
 * this file (`nInnerForShard` computed `ceil(min(shardSamples, remaining) /
 * chunkSamples)`, which is SMALLER for a boundary shard) and caught only by
 * checking the REAL captured footer for nm000329's shard 1 (`c/0/1`, not
 * just `c/0/0`): its `Content-Length` is 7,651,790; the real 1204-byte
 * footer parses to 75 entries -- the SAME 75 as the non-boundary shard 0 --
 * with local indices 0-63 present (offsets chaining contiguously from 0,
 * `sum(nbytes) == 7_650_586`) and 64-74 marked absent (`2^64 - 1` in both
 * fields, per the spec: a chunk entirely past the array's real extent is
 * absent, not omitted from the index). The old formula computed `nInner =
 * 64` for this shard, so it Range-read only the LAST 1028 bytes of the
 * footer (`footerByteLength(64)`) instead of the real 1204 -- a slice that
 * starts 176 bytes (11 entries) into the true footer, so every local index
 * it parsed was the WRONG entry, shifted by 11 chunks (44 s at 250 Hz).
 * Nothing errored: every misread entry still pointed at a real, full-size,
 * cleanly-decoding chunk, so the caller got plausible-looking signal from
 * the wrong point in the recording. `nInnerForShard` below computes the
 * constant directly from `shard_samples`/`chunk_samples` and does not take
 * `nSamples` (or even a shard index) as an argument at all -- there is
 * nothing about a specific shard that could change the answer.
 *
 * The shard footer is the last `n_inner * 16 + 4` bytes: `n_inner` pairs of
 * little-endian uint64 `(offset, nbytes)` (each pair's `offset` is a byte
 * offset INTO THE SHARD OBJECT, so PRESENT entries chain contiguously from
 * 0) plus a trailing crc32c word -- this module never verifies that
 * checksum, only strips it. An absent inner chunk is marked `2^64 - 1` in
 * BOTH fields (`SHARD_ABSENT_MARKER`) and contributes no bytes to the shard
 * at all -- the byte offsets of the entries around it simply do not advance
 * for it.
 *
 * A PRESENT boundary chunk (a chunk whose nominal span crosses the array's
 * real `n_samples`) is still stored FULL SIZE (`chunk_samples` columns wide)
 * and fill-padded past the array's real extent -- Zarr never emits a
 * narrower chunk. Verified against nm000329 shard 1's own final present
 * entry (local index 63, footer offset 7,560,477, nbytes 90,109, nominally
 * covering samples [138000, 139000) though only [138000, 138750) is real):
 * `decodeBloscZstdInt16` on those exact bytes returns 63,000 values (63 x
 * 1000), not 63 x 750. `chunkSampleSpan` below reports the chunk's VALID
 * span (truncated at `n_samples`) SEPARATELY from its decoded STRIDE
 * (always `chunk_samples`) for exactly this reason -- see `taste.ts`'s
 * `DecodedSegment` doc for the conflation this separation prevents.
 *
 * No I/O in this file -- `read-window.ts` does the fetching and decoding;
 * this file only computes which shards, which local chunk indices, and
 * which byte ranges to ask for.
