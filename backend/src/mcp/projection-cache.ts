/**
 * Derived-projection cache for the recording-level MCP tools (epic #1065
 * phase 3, issue #1295; design doc section 7).
 *
 * `index.json` is fetched through the real zarr sub-app and its own edge
 * cache (`index-reader.ts`); the compact PROJECTIONS this file caches --
 * `list_recordings`' full recording list, `get_events`' per-store row
 * groups, and `render_overview`'s rendered PNG bytes -- are a SEPARATE
 * cache layer keyed on synthetic `https://mcp.nemar.org/_cache/...` URLs.
 * `mcp.nemar.org` here is a constant key NAMESPACE, never a real route the
 * MCP sub-app answers -- these keys exist only inside the Cache API.
 *
 * THE KEY CARRIES A CONVERSION IDENTITY, NOT JUST A COMMIT, and that is the
 * correctness of this whole layer. An earlier version keyed on
 * `(dataset_id, source_commit)` alone and asserted "a re-conversion mints a new
 * `source_commit`, so the OLD key never again resolves to different bytes".
 * That is false. `source_commit` is the DATASET REPO's HEAD
 * (`generate_zarr.py` publishes `head_commit`), not an identity of the
 * conversion, and the documented back-catalog mechanism re-converts at an
 * UNCHANGED HEAD: an engine bump re-queues a `done` row and bumps no dataset
 * version (ADR 0033), and an ADR 0023 `--clean` rebuild and a retry after an
 * infra failure are the same shape. So the old key resolved to stale bytes for
 * a full 7 days while `index.json` itself refreshed in 5 minutes, and nothing
 * purges these synthetic keys. For `array/` that meant serving a stale
 * `scale[]`/`offset[]` against re-quantized data -- silently wrong PHYSICAL
 * VALUES, with no error and nothing in `filled_ranges`; for `shardidx/` it
 * meant replaying stale byte offsets as Range reads against a new object,
 * where every 206 and length check passes by construction because the origin
 * returns exactly the bytes asked for, just the wrong ones.
 *
 * `zarr_converted_at` is that identity: a plain `datasets` column, set to
 * `datetime('now')` by every conversion, and available from the D1 row the
 * tools already load BEFORE any fetch -- which is the constraint that rules out
 * the index's own ETag or `updated_utc`, since the point of the `recordings`
 * entry is to answer without fetching `index.json` at all. A re-conversion that
 * republishes byte-identical output does needlessly invalidate, which is the
 * safe direction to err in.
 *
 * The namespace is ENVIRONMENT-SCOPED for the same class of reason. It used to
 * be the literal `https://mcp.nemar.org/_cache`, but `caches.default` is
 * zone-scoped and both `mcp.nemar.org` and `mcp-test.nemar.org` are custom
 * domains on the nemar.org zone, so prod and staging read and wrote each
 * other's entries for the same `(dataset_id, commit)` while their `data_base`
 * pointed at different buckets. Every other cache key in this worker is already
 * environment-derived (`zarr-data.ts` uses the request origin, `index-reader.ts`
 * uses `zarrCacheBaseUrl(env)`); this now matches.
 *
 * Given a key that changes on every conversion, the 7-day TTL is sound.
 * Contrast `zarr-data.ts`'s `cacheControlFor`: ITS tokened/untokened split
 * applies to `zarr.json` and the dataset-level documents (`index.json`,
 * `manifest.json`, `events.parquet`), which get a SHORT untokened TTL so a
 * re-conversion surfaces quickly there; a chunk object there gets the flat
 * 24h case regardless of tokening, because a chunk key does not change on
 * re-conversion.
 *
 * `put()` always goes through `ctx.waitUntil` and is never awaited on the
 * response path -- the same `safeCachePut` discipline `zarr-data.ts` uses:
 * a `CacheLike.put` that throws (synchronously OR as a rejected promise) is
 * caught, logged once, and treated as though the write never happened,
 * never as a request failure.
