/**
 * `oidcBearer(scopes)`: the ONE way a route accepts an OpenID Connect access token (epic #2014 phase
 * #2018; ADR 0119 rules 4 and 14).
 *
 * An access token is accepted only by the routes that serve its scopes, and every other route refuses
 * it (`resolveApiKeyUser` answers `oidc_token` for an `nmo_` bearer). This middleware is the
 * acceptance: a route that serves a scope names it here, and it is the only thing in the Worker that
 * lets an access token AUTHENTICATE a request. (Revocation and introspection read tokens too, as form
 * parameters a client passes about a token, never as the credential of the request.) It is on
 * `/oauth/userinfo` (`openid`) and, in `routes/compute/auth.ts`, on three instances for the compute
 * routes that serve `compute.*` (`compute.read`, `compute.stats` and `compute.reserve`), and
 * `test/oidc-token-allowlist.test.ts` fails when this middleware appears on a route it does not list.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, READ LIVE AT EVERY CALL (`TOKEN_LOOKUP_SQL`): the token is an `nmo_at_` access
 * token NEMAR issued, not revoked and not expired, its client is active, and, for a token that names
 * an account, its grant is live and the account passes its client's sign-in rule NOW (status,
 * deletion, kind, ORCID proof), never what the token row or the moment of issue said. A CLI key, a
 * refresh token or a client secret is not an access token.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS (RFC 6750 section 3), always `no-store`:
 *   - no `Authorization` header: 401, `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` and an empty body (no error code
 *     anywhere, section 3.1);
 *   - anything that is not a live access token: 401, `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"`;
 *   - a live token without every scope the route needs: 403,
 *     `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", scope="<the scopes>"`.
 * On success `c.var.oidcToken` holds the client, the account (with its claim columns, from the same
 * read), the scopes and the audience. The audience is the route's to check if it serves only one.
