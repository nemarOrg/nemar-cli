/**
 * `resolvePrincipal`: whose credential is this (ADR 0078).
 *
 * The one question the private site asks on every request, answered by the
 * same readers the HTTP API uses rather than by a copy of them:
 * `findSessionByCookieId` for a private-site session, `resolveApiKeyUser` for
 * an API key. A second copy of either SELECT is how a surface ends up
 * honouring a credential the API would refuse (ADR 0056's review found
 * exactly that), so this file owns only the mapping onto `Principal`, and one
 * mapping, `toPrincipal`, serves both kinds.
 *
 * It takes a credential and returns an account. It never takes an account and
 * returns anything, which is ADR 0078's first rule: no method acts for a user
 * without that user's credential or a one-time grant.
