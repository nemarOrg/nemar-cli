/**
 * Legal holds on compute records (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118; design section 9): a hold on
 * one job, or on every job of one account, that the retention sweep honors.
 *
 * A hold is a row of `compute_legal_holds` (migration 0118): a D1 flag, because R2 has no versioning and
 * no per-object hold, and the records bucket's own lock covers only the retention period. Placing and
 * releasing one is OWNER-ONLY and audited in the same batch as the change; the role is read from the
 * database in the statement itself (a caller that says it is an owner is not believed). A hold is
 * released, never removed. There is at most one active hold per (scope, ref): a second placement is a
 * conflict. `reason` is a fixed word, never free text.
 *
 * `HELD_SQL` is the one predicate "this job is held, by itself or by its account", used by the
 * retention sweep both to choose its candidates and again, per job, immediately before it deletes.
