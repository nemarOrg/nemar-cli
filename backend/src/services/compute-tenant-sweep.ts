/**
 * The tenant sweep (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118; design section 6, "Jobs that skipped the
 * reservation"): NEMAR proves that every job in the Tapis tenant is accounted for.
 *
 *   `sweepTenantJobs(env, "live")`   every 30 minutes: the jobs in the tenant that have not ended
 *   `sweepTenantJobs(env, "week")`   once a day: every job of the last seven days, and the rest of the
 *                                    day's reconciliation (Expanse's own figures against the ledger, and
 *                                    the ACCESS reports a person has to look at)
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES TO A TAPIS JOB NO ROW OWNS, in order:
 *  1. a job bound by `tapis_uuid` to a row is NEMAR's own (a pipeline job, a person's job, a partner's
 *     bound reservation) and is left alone;
 *  2. a job tagged `nemar_job:<id>` for a row that exists is NEMAR's: the submit race (the submitter's
 *     answer was lost, or the sweep met the job before the submitter bound it). A row that still has no
 *     Tapis job and can take it is BOUND to it and nothing is cancelled. A tag for a row that is bound to
 *     another job, or ended, or has a cancel pending, is a DUPLICATE of a NEMAR job: it is cancelled if
 *     it is live, the row is flagged `mismatch`, and it is never indexed, charged or counted as use that
 *     skipped the reservation. This is also what catches the second orphan of a row, which the row's one
 *     orphan slot (`orphan_tapis_uuid`) cannot hold: the sweep sees every duplicate on every run;
 *  3. anything else skipped the reservation. An index row is written FIRST (source `partner`, client
 *     `tenant`, `spec_digest` the SHA-256 of the Tapis fields read, `cancel_reason` `unreserved`, or
 *     `unattributed` when the owner maps to no active account, the flags set), then the job is cancelled
 *     at Tapis, then the row is followed to its end like any cancelled job and charged what it used to
 *     the PARTNER POOL `tenant` (counted against the `people` budget), NEVER to a person, however clear it
 *     is whose job it was. Moving the charge later is a ledger operation Epic D's partner-pool phase
 *     exposes; no route reaches the partner pool today. The row is written before the cancel so a crash
 *     between the two leaves a row to finish, not an unrecorded job.
 *
 * THE RULES.
 *  - PRODUCTION ONLY and only while compute is on (`computeEnabled`): the dev database shares real users,
 *    and a sweep that cancels in a tenant must be a tenant the owner has switched on. Both the cron wiring
 *    and this function refuse otherwise, before anything is read.
 *  - A TAPIS THAT CANNOT BE LISTED CHANGES NOTHING: a failed listing is a fixed word and no row is
 *    written, no job cancelled and no charge made. A listing cut off at its page bound is reported at
 *    error level, because a job past the bound is a job not seen.
 *  - BOUNDED: five pages of 1,000, at most 25 unbound jobs handled a run (the rest are `deferred` and
 *    taken next run), ten rows of its own to follow a run, one log line.
 *  - NOTHING IT READS IS TRUSTED: the owner, queue and resources of a Tapis record are clamped to what the
 *    table takes, an unknown partition prices at nothing (flagged `mismatch`), and a record that cannot be
 *    read is not guessed at.
 *  - THE ORDER OF A LISTING IS ASKED FOR, NOT KNOWN: `orderBy=created(desc)` is the spelling of Tapis's
 *    documentation and UNVERIFIED against a real tenant; if it is ignored, a tenant past 5,000 jobs would
 *    show only its oldest, which is why truncation is loud.
 *
 * The charge is an `overrun` entry of the ledger (`unreservedChargeStatements`): the table refuses a
 * `charge` that closes no hold, and a job that skipped the reservation has none.
