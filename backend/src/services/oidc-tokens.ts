/**
 * The token store and the token endpoint's three grants (epic #2014 phase #2018; ADR 0119 rules 1,
 * 3, 4, 12 and 13). The routes are `routes/oauth.ts`; the table is migration 0123.
 *
 * TOKENS ARE OPAQUE AND STORED ONLY AS THEIR SHA-256. `nmo_at_` (access) and `nmo_rt_` (refresh)
 * plus 256 random bits as unpadded base64url. The value is in the one response that issues it and
 * nowhere else; a token is found by `hashApiKey`, the hash every NEMAR credential is stored by. With
 * 256 random bits there is nothing to guess, so no slow hash and no key: a stolen table yields no
 * token. Nothing here logs a token, a code, a verifier or a secret.
 *
 * EVERY DECISION IS D1'S, IN THE STATEMENT THAT WRITES. A read before a batch only chooses which
 * batch to send and says why a request failed; the batch's own WHERE clauses re-read the code, the
 * client, the grant and the account and decide, and `meta.changes` of the statement that mints is the
 * winner. A refused mint writes nothing.
 *
 *   AUTHORIZATION CODE. The code is read once. Presented again by its own client it is a second
 *   redemption at once (below), whatever verifier or address it carries; otherwise the PKCE verifier
 *   is checked against its S256 challenge and the redirect address exactly, in constant time, and a
 *   mismatch writes nothing. Then one batch:
 *   the access token is inserted only while the code is unused and live, is this client's, and its
 *   client, grant and account still pass (`CODE_CLAIM_PREDICATE`, the claim of the issue verbatim,
 *   plus the gates); the refresh token only beside that access token; and the code is marked used
 *   only when this request's access token row exists. So two redemptions in flight cannot both mint,
 *   and a redemption whose gates failed spends nothing. A code that lost the claim and is used by now
 *   is a SECOND REDEMPTION: every token issued from it is revoked (`code_replay`), and nothing else
 *   is written. Tokens carry the CODE's scopes, never the grant's (which accumulate).
 *
 *   REFRESH. One batch rotates: the child refresh token is inserted only while the parent is live,
 *   unrevoked, this client's, its grant, client and account still pass, and EITHER the parent is
 *   unspent with no child yet, OR it was spent under 30 seconds ago and has exactly one child (the
 *   retried request: one more child, never two); the access token is inserted beside that child; and
 *   the parent is marked spent if it was not already, so the grace is measured from the first
 *   rotation. THE CHILDREN OF ONE PARENT ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: rotating one of them revokes its
 *   unspent siblings (`refresh_superseded`) in the same batch, so the retry's second child and the
 *   first can never both go on rotating; whichever is presented first wins, and the other one,
 *   presented later, is a revoked token. A parent that is revoked, or spent and past the grace, or
 *   already retried, revokes its whole family (`refresh_reuse`), in a statement that re-checks that
 *   very condition. A refresh
 *   token keeps its scopes; the access token gets the scopes asked for, which may only narrow. The
 *   child expires 30 days after it is minted and never after the family's absolute expiry, which
 *   every rotation copies from the family's first token (90 days after the code was redeemed).
 *
 *   CLIENT CREDENTIALS. One access token for the client's machine-only scopes (`compute.stats`):
 *   no account, no grant, no family, no identity token, no refresh token.
 *
 * `client_id` IN THESE TABLES IS THE `oidc_clients.id` ROW ID, NOT THE PUBLIC `oc_...` STRING.
