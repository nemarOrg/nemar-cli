/**
 * The per-job record and the records bucket (epic #2005 phase A3, #2008; ADR 0118 decision 7, design
 * sections 7 and 9).
 *
 * NEMAR is the record of every tenant job, whichever front door submitted it. D1 holds an index row
 * (`compute_jobs`, account id and fixed words only); everything else a job leaves is here, in the
 * private records bucket, reached through the Worker's binding:
 *
 *   records/<id>/identity.json            who submitted it (restricted: see `readRecordObject`)
 *   records/<id>/spec.json                what was asked for; its SHA-256 is the job row's spec_digest
 *   records/<id>/submitted/bundle.tar.gz  the code bundle (or submitted/<path> for each partner file)
 *   records/<id>/bundle-manifest.json     the files inside the archive, with its digest and size
 *   records/<id>/result-manifest.json     the launcher's manifest.json, kept under this name
 *   records/<id>/provenance.json          the launcher's provenance
 *   records/<id>/result.json              the launcher's result
 *   logs/<id>/tapisjob.out, launcher.log  the logs (a shorter retention)
 *   incoming/<id>/bundle.tar.gz           an upload in flight (or incoming/<id>/<path> per file)
 *
 * The node and the results bucket use `manifest.json`; the records bucket calls it
 * `result-manifest.json`; there is no `failure.json`. The results bucket's keys, `jobs/<id>/outputs/`
 * and `jobs/<id>/launcher/`, are the outputs routes' (#2010), and are built by the contract's
 * `resultsOutputKey` and `resultsLauncherKey`.
 *
 * THE RULES, each one deliberate:
 *  - A record is written once, and never rewritten. The records bucket is locked by prefix (bucket
 *    configuration, never code), so an overwrite is refused by the bucket; this module never asks for
 *    one. Every write is create-only (`putOnce`): a key that exists is left alone, and a write that
 *    finds one with other content says so rather than replacing it. An identity snapshot that exists is
 *    kept whatever the account says now: what was true at submission is the record.
 *  - NOTHING IS COPIED INTO `records/` BEFORE THE HOLD COMMITS. A record is written after the job's
 *    batch, never before it, and the bundle is copied only after the job's row (which exists only if
 *    its hold does) has been read: a bucket lock would make an orphan record for a refused job
 *    permanent. A bundle waits in `incoming/`, which a lifecycle rule empties after two days.
 *  - Identity is in the records bucket only. Reading it, or a submitted file, is OWNER-ONLY, needs a
 *    stated reason of 8 to 200 characters, and writes the `compute.record.read` audit row BEFORE any
 *    byte is read; if that write fails the read is refused. The row says who, what and why; the bucket's
 *    own access log is the other half.
 *  - The only presigned reads of a record are `presignBundleRead` (the launcher's address for the
 *    job's OWN bundle, 10 minutes, no other key) and the 5-minute address `readRecordObject` gives an
 *    owner for one submitted file or log.
 *  - Logs carry job ids and fixed words, never a path a person chose.
 *  - A bound the Worker relies on is read back through the binding: a presigned PUT can be checked by
 *    its checksum header only where R2 enforces it, which has not been verified, so the object's SIZE is
 *    what `finalizeBundle` compares.
 *  - A Worker invocation may make at most 1,000 subrequests, and a partner's per-file upload costs one
 *    `CopyObject` each, so it is bounded at `PARTNER_FILES_MAX` files whatever the owner's limit.
