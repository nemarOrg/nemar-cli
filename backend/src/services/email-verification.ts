/**
 * Email verification for web accounts (ADR 0040 phase 2, #1252).
 *
 * A web account is created by ORCID sign-up, which proves the person and not
 * the inbox: ORCID never returns an email, so the address is typed into a form
 * and taken on trust. ADR 0040 makes the base tier need both, so a web account
 * lands at `pending` and reaches `verified` by repeating a 6-digit code mailed
 * to that address.
 *
 * Three things live here because more than one route needs each of them:
 * issuing a code, performing the `pending` -> `verified` transition, and
 * telling the admins an account reached `verified`. The email-code sign-in
 * (`POST /auth/code/verify`) proves the same inbox by the same means, so it
 * performs the same transition rather than a similar one.
 *
 * Non-production delivery is fenced, for the reason recorded in AGENTS.md: the
 * dev D1 holds roughly 609 real addresses and the dev worker holds a live
 * RESEND_API_KEY. Outside production a code is only ever issued for a
 * synthetic test address, and there it is echoed in the response instead of
 * mailed — the same rule /auth/email/change/request follows, with no
 * admin/owner bypass, because this endpoint's target is an address chosen by
 * whoever is signed in.

 * executes as a single implicit transaction.
 *
 * Two statements rather than one CASE expression, because the caller needs to
 * know whether the tier actually moved: the admin notification belongs to the
 * transition, not to every re-proof of an inbox. The first is conditional on
 * `status = 'pending'`, which is what makes that answer race-free and
 * idempotent — only one of two concurrent verifications can match it — and
 * `changes` on its result is the answer. The second stamps `email_verified`
 * for a row that was already past `pending`; inside the same transaction the
 * first statement's write is visible, so it matches nothing when the
 * promotion just happened.
 *
 * `approved` and `revoked` rows are never re-tiered; they only ever gain the
 * `email_verified` stamp, which is a fact about the inbox and true regardless
 * of tier.
 *
 * THROWS if the batch fails, and then nothing landed — no promotion, no
 * session, no stamp. Callers that have already consumed a single-use code by
 * the time they get here must catch that and say so; see the two verify
 * routes.
 *
 * The audit row is written here rather than by the callers so a new road to
 * `verified` cannot arrive without one. It is deliberately NOT in the batch:
 * by then the transition has committed, and rolling a verified account back
 * because an audit insert failed would be the worse outcome (that trade-off
 * is the same one finalizeApproval makes, for the same reason).
