 * named non-placeholder Authors, and an ethics approval statement are hard
 * requirements for native submissions. These are the mechanically checkable
 * checks; adequacy beyond them (is the name meaningful, is the README about

   * opposite: `Authors` must NOT name anybody. `dataset_description.json` is
   * part of the dataset -- git-tracked, and served publicly from the data
   * plane -- so a real name there defeats the blind no matter what NEMAR
   * withholds elsewhere. The depositor blinds their own file, exactly as they
   * would blind a manuscript for a double-blind venue, and NEMAR refuses the
   * release if they have not.
   *
   * Permitting rather than requiring was the first draft, and it was wrong: it
   * let a depositor ask for an anonymous release, pass every gate, and be
   * named by their own file on a public dataset page.
   *
   * NEMAR enforces this for `Authors` because the field is structured. It
   * cannot for README, `participants.tsv`, or identifiers inside signal
   * headers -- those are REPORTED by phase 4's blind check, never enforced
   * here, and no copy anywhere may imply otherwise.
   *
   * Every other minimum still applies unchanged: a blinded deposit needs a
   * descriptive Name and an ethics statement like any other.
