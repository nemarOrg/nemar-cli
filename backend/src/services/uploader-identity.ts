/**
 * The uploader's citable identity (#1255, epic #1250).
 *
 * DOIs attribute the person who deposited the dataset. That attribution used
 * to be `users.username` — a NEMAR login handle like `jdoe23`, emitted into
 * DataCite as a `<contributorName>` and into Zenodo as a creator. A username
 * is not a name: it is not what the person is cited as anywhere else, it does
 * not decompose into given/family parts, and it cannot be reconciled with an
 * ORCID record. Migration 0051 added `users.given_name`/`users.family_name`
 * for exactly this, with ORCID as the canonical source.
 *
 * This module is the single place that turns those two nullable columns into
 * something citable, so every DOI path agrees on the answer AND on when there
 * is no answer. `null` is the whole point of the return type: a half-filled
 * name (given but no family) is NOT citable, and the correct response is to
 * block the mint (see the publish-block reason below), never to fall back to
 * the username.
