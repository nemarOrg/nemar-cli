/**
 * Which datasets may be federated (epic #1586, phase 4; ADR 0084).
 *
 * ONE predicate, written once as a list of named terms. Each term carries its SQL
 * and its TypeScript form side by side, so the query that selects candidates and
 * the check that re-confirms a row cannot drift apart: a test drives the same
 * generated rows through both and fails on any disagreement.
 *
 * DECIDED FROM THE D1 ROW, never from an HTTP `anonymous` value (ADR 0065). The
 * writer then refuses a dataset whose gathered `metadata.json` does not say
 * `anonymous: false` as well, as a second and independent guard; the two
 * disagreeing is an anonymity-class finding (see neurobagel-writer.ts).
 *
 * A dataset is eligible when it is:
 *   - active (`status`), public (`visibility`), and NOT anonymous (`anonymous = 0`;
 *     NULL is unknown, and unknown is not false);
 *   - first published (`first_published_at`), not withdrawn (`withdrawn_at`);
 *   - holding at least one `dataset_versions` row;
 *   - a real dataset: an `nm` id below the reserved fixture band (ADR 0068), or an
 *     `on` OpenNeuro mirror (INCLUDED by the owner's decision), and neither a
 *     sandbox nor an exemplar row. `xx` ids (sandboxes and the exemplar fleet) and the
 *     reserved `nm0999xx` fixtures are excluded by that term, in EVERY environment:
 *     the store and the index schema hold `nm` and `on` ids only, so an exemplar that
 *     the predicate admitted would be rewritten on every run and never indexed.
 *
 * "Deleted" is not a separate term: deleting a dataset removes its row, and a row
 * with `status = 'deleted'` fails the `active` term.
