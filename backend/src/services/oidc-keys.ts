/**
 * The OpenID Connect provider's signing keys (epic #2014 phase #2016; ADR 0119, decisions 2 and
 * 4): generating them, keeping the private half encrypted, publishing the public half as a JSON Web
 * Key Set, signing a token with ES256, and rotating.
 *
 * THE LIFE OF A KEY. Every key is made as `next`, published from that moment so a client has time to
 * fetch it, and becomes `current` (the one that signs) only when it is at least 24 hours old, unless
 * the owner forces it. The key that was `current` becomes `retired` and stays published for seven
 * days, so a token signed just before a rotation still verifies. The first rotation of an empty
 * table makes a `current` and a `next` together; there is no window in which nothing signs once
 * that has happened.
 *
 * THE PRIVATE KEY NEVER LEAVES. It is generated in memory, encrypted with `encrypt()` under
 * `OIDC_SECRET` before it is stored, decrypted only to sign, and returned by nothing: the published
 * set is built from an allow-list of public members, so a private member that reached the public
 * column by any route is still not emitted. A decrypted key is cached for the life of the isolate,
 * keyed by the key's id AND the secret it was decrypted under, so a warm cache is no way around a
 * wrong secret.
 *
 * ROTATION IS ONE BATCH, AND THE TABLE'S INDEXES ARE ITS LOCK. The state is read, a key is made, and
 * the changes go to D1 in one batch (a transaction): retire the current key named in the read,
 * promote the `next` key named in the read, insert the new `next`, and write the audit row. A second
 * rotation that read the same state finds its statements matching nothing, and its insert of a new
 * `next` (or of a first `current`) breaks a partial unique index, so the whole batch is refused,
 * which is reported as `conflict` and leaves the table as the winner made it. The caller reads the
 * keys again. Only the keys' own unique violation is a conflict: any other constraint failure is a
 * defect and is thrown.
 *
 * Each statement names the key id it read AND the state it read it in (`kid = ? AND state = ...`).
 * The id stops a stale rotation from promoting the key the winner had just made, at the age of zero.
 * The state matters when two rotations, or a rotation and a revocation, finish between a slow
 * writer's read and its write: without it the writer's statement would match a key that is no longer
 * `next` or `current` and rewrite it into a state its stamps forbid, and the failure would be a CHECK
 * violation (a 500) instead of a clean `conflict`. A test per statement holds each.
 *
 * ROTATION PROVES THE KEY IT PROMOTES CAN BE READ. A `next` key that was encrypted under another
 * `OIDC_SECRET` would become `current` and then fail on the first token: so before the batch is
 * built, the key about to sign is decrypted and checked against the public key published for it,
 * and a key that cannot be read refuses the rotation (`key_unreadable`) and changes nothing.
 *
 * A FORCED ROTATION IS NOT INSTANT. A key published a moment ago may not be in the key set a client
 * cached, so `force` refuses while the next key is under 6 minutes old unless the owner says it is
 * an emergency (`emergency`), and the audit row records both.
 *
 * Time is D1's (`datetime('now')`), never the Worker's clock, for the same reason as the re-pull
 * dispatch cap: one clock for the rule and the stamps it reads.
