/**
 * What ending an account does to its compute (epic #2005 phase A8, #2013; AGENTS.md, "Revocation
 * cascades, always"; ADR 0118; design section 7): as statements for the caller to run in the SAME
 * batch as its own credential revocations, exactly as `mailReleaseStatements`
 * (`services/ticket-assignment.ts`) does for an admin's tickets.
 *
 * TWO CALLERS, and the count is the point: `finalizeRevocation` (`routes/admin/users.ts`: admin revoke,
 * by username and by id) and `tombstoneUserCascade` (`db/user-tombstone.ts`: the owner-only soft delete
 * and the scheduled sweep of the live tests' accounts, which run the same function, so it counts once).
 * These are the two paths that end EVERY credential an account holds. A THIRD path that ends an account
 * needs these statements too. The list is `COMPUTE_END_CALLERS` below, and a source scan
 * (`backend/test/compute-end-callers.test.ts`) holds it to the code: it fails when either caller drops the
 * statements (as does `compute-release-cascade.test.ts`), and when a function that revokes all of a
 * user's keys and sessions THROUGH THE STATEMENT SHAPES THE SCAN RECOGNISES (`UPDATE tokens SET revoked_at
 * ... WHERE user_id ...`, and `UPDATE web_sessions SET revoked_at` or `DELETE FROM web_sessions WHERE
 * user_id ...`, however quoted or ordered, inline or in a constant or helper it names) neither runs them
 * nor is named in `COMPUTE_END_EXCEPTIONS`. A revocation written another way (SQL assembled from parts the
 * scan cannot fold) is not recognised: the scan is a tripwire for the shapes the Worker uses.
 *
 * A PARTNER'S RESERVATION IS LEFT ALONE. A job with `source = 'partner'` and no Tapis job yet is a
 * reservation the partner will launch its own Tapis job under (phase D4), and NEMAR never writes a launch
 * specification or takes a submit lease for it, so "never reached Tapis" below is TRUE of it whether or
 * not the partner has launched: ending it would release a hold for a job that may be running. The cascade
 * neither records an intent on it, cancels it nor releases its hold; the pools are frozen all the same,
 * and the reservation is the partner contract's to resolve (an open point for D4's brief). A partner job
 * that HAS a Tapis job is an ordinary live job here: it records the intent and the retried sweep cancels
 * it at Tapis, because NEMAR owns every Tapis job.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED, and a later reader should not "fix" either:
 *  - A ROLE DEMOTION. Compute has nothing to do with an admin's standing: a person demoted to member is
 *    still an account in good standing with a grant, a pool and jobs that are theirs, and ending those
 *    would take a job away from someone who did nothing wrong. The demotion cascade ends what exists
 *    only for admins (the docs credential, the support tickets).
 *  - REVOKING AN API KEY (self-service, the owner's, the emailed regeneration). A job's identity is
 *    the account's, recorded in NEMAR's job row; Tapis never sees the key, and a person who revokes one
 *    key still has the account and its other credentials. A key's end is not an account's end.
 *    CONSEQUENCE, stated so nobody is surprised: a stolen key's jobs that were already submitted keep
 *    running (and are charged to the account) until the person cancels them or an administrator revokes
 *    the account; ending the key stops new submissions only.
 *  - Logout, which ends sessions and nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, in this order, every statement keyed by the account:
 *  1. every LIVE job (but a partner's reservation with no Tapis job) records the intent to cancel
 *     (`cancel_requested_at`) and the reason `account_ended`, keeping a reason and a time that were
 *     already recorded (the first cause stands: a person's earlier cancel stays `user`);
 *  2. a job that provably never reached Tapis is ended HERE: `cancelled`, its hold released and the
 *     release stamped as the settlement, as `commitTerminal` does it for a cancel (steps 2 to 4 are
 *     that job's terminal transition and its settlement, in the one batch). "Provably" is exactly the
 *     rule `driveCancel` applies before it ends a row itself: no Tapis job, no launch specification
 *     written (a submit whose answer was lost writes it BEFORE the call, and a Tapis job may exist that
 *     no search can see) and no live submit lease (a submitter is in flight). Ending any other job in
 *     SQL would release a hold for a job that then runs, charged to nobody;
 *  3. the holds of the jobs step 2 ended are released (the ledger's own conditional INSERT, the same
 *     one `releaseStatements` writes, so a job that never started consumes nothing and nothing is
 *     refunded);
 *  4. those jobs are stamped settled;
 *  5. every pool of the account is frozen, so no new hold is taken for an account that has ended
 *     (the holder's own pool; a frozen pool refuses a hold as `suspended`).
 * A job at Tapis, or one a submit may have reached, keeps its hold and stays live with the intent
 * recorded: THE TAPIS CANCEL IS NEVER MADE HERE. A network call inside a batch cannot be retried and
 * would hold the credential cascade hostage to a third party, so the batch records the intent and
 * `sweepComputeCancellations` (the 30-minute tick) cancels at Tapis, again and again until Tapis
 * says it is over, then charges what the job used. Nothing in this file calls Tapis.
 *
 * EVERY STATEMENT ENDS IN A WHERE CLAUSE, and uses plain `?` placeholders only, because
 * `tombstoneUserCascade` called with `onlyIfEmail` appends ` AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id =
 * ? AND email = ?)` to each statement's text and its two binds after the statement's own: a statement
 * that ended in anything else (an ORDER BY, a LIMIT, a trailing semicolon) would not take the guard, and
 * a row whose address changed since the sweep read it would lose its compute to a cascade that
 * tombstoned nothing.
 *
 * REPLAYABLE: a second run changes nothing (a retried revoke re-enters its batch). Held by the ledger
 * too: its release statement writes only for a hold that is still open.
