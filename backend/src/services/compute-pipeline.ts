/**
 * NEMAR's own pipeline dispatch (epic #2005 phase A6, #2011; ADR 0118; design section 10): run a
 * processing recipe over one version of one public EEG dataset through the compute gateway, leave one
 * stamp per dataset version, recipe, recipe version and engine so the queue knows what is current, and
 * read the stamps back to their end.
 *
 *   `dispatchPipelineJob`   claim the stamp, resolve the recipe into a complete job, make the job and
 *                           its hold (`createJob`), link the stamp, and submit (`submitComputeJob`)
 *   `syncPipelineStamps`    move `dispatched` stamps to `succeeded` or `failed` from their job's end
 *   `listPipelineStamps`    a page of stamps, filtered, after a sync
 *   `pipelineCandidates`    the eligible datasets a recipe has not been run over at their newest version
 *   `dispatchEligible`      a run over the next `limit` of them, each through `dispatchPipelineJob`
 *   `pipelineDryRun`        what a run would dispatch, the estimated SU, and what blocks the rest; reads only
 *
 * THE RULES, each one deliberate:
 *  - THE WORKER SUPPLIES THE FACTS, NEVER THE REQUEST. The dataset row (eligibility, ADR 0065: the
 *    stored `anonymous` column and nothing a caller says), the version row, the service account, the
 *    pool and the runtime image all come from the Worker's own tables and configuration. A request names
 *    a recipe, a dataset and optionally a version; it names nothing else.
 *  - THE RECIPE IS RESOLVED BEFORE `createJob` (the phase's amendment of 2026-11-04). The job is made
 *    from a complete specification: the recipe's name beside the runtime (`image`), NEMAR's own runtime
 *    image (`COMPUTE_RUNTIME_IMAGE`, a digest-pinned reference), the command, and the arguments with
 *    the image digest. So `spec.json`, `spec_digest` and `launch_spec_digest` describe what actually
 *    ran, and no recipe job ever exists in a form the launch-specification builder would refuse. The
 *    recipe is never run with an image other than the one its `--image-digest` names: the digest is
 *    taken from the same reference the job's `image` is, and the Worker compares it with the
 *    launcher's provenance before it accepts a result (`verifyResults`).
 *  - THE STAMP IS CLAIMED FIRST. A `dispatched` row for the tuple is inserted before anything else is
 *    written, and a partial unique index refuses a second live or succeeded row for one tuple, so two
 *    runs racing for a tuple produce one stamp and one job. A refused hold ends the stamp `refused`
 *    with the ledger's word; nothing else is left (the job's creation is atomic with its hold).
 *  - ONE KEY FOR ONE ATTEMPT. The job's idempotency key is made from the tuple and the attempt number,
 *    so a crash between the job's creation and the stamp's link is found again by the key: the sync
 *    links the job instead of failing the stamp.
 *  - THE STAMP SAYS WHAT RAN. It is claimed with the recipe table's version and engine and, when the
 *    job succeeds, rewritten from the recipe's own dataset record (`readRecipeRecord`). A record that
 *    is missing, unreadable, or names another recipe ends the stamp `failed`; the job is untouched.
 *  - NOTHING HERE TOUCHES GITHUB OR MAIL. A run reaches D1, the compute buckets and Tapis, all through
 *    the gateway's own services.

 * guard inside every hold (`PIPELINE_LIVE_JOBS_GUARD_SQL`), so a run that raced another for the last slot
 * is refused there. The daily cap is only this read, a clamp and not a guard, for two reasons of P1:
 * `PIPELINE_JOBS_TODAY_SQL` is a full scan of `compute_jobs` (no index serves it), which a guard would
 * run inside every pipeline hold's write; and the ways around that (an account-bound count served by
 * `compute_jobs_account_created`, or a new index) need an account bind or a migration, which P1 has not.
 * So runs that race can together pass it: by up to (the number of racing runs minus 1) times
 * min(the per-invocation bound, the daily room, the live room), the bound of one run each time. The money
 * ceiling is a different fence: the pipelines pool's balance, enforced atomically by the same hold
 * (`HOLD_INSERT_SQL`; pipelines have no budget pool), though an overrun can push it below zero, so both
 * caps only pace spending. A single named dataset is bounded by the live guard and the pool's balance
 * and is only COUNTED by the daily cap, never refused by it (the owner ruled this for P1 and may override
 * later). An atomic daily guard, if wanted, belongs in P2 beside the tenant-ceiling guard, with an
 * account-bound count.
