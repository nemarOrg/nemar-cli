/**
 * The publication review, Worker side: the write path (ADR 0102).
 *
 * When the identifier screen of a publication request reports for a commit and its gate is clear
 * or needs an acknowledgment, the Worker starts a review of that commit: it records the attempt in
 * `publication_reviews` (migration 0098) and dispatches a workflow to `nemarDatasets/.github`.
 * The workflow CLAIMS the review (the Worker accepts the one-shot token, checks the request is
 * still the one it was dispatched for, and records the time) before it spends anything, reads the
 * root documents at the commit as git data, asks a model four questions and posts a report. The
 * Worker parses it at the door ({@link storePublicationReviewResult}), derives the verdict, and
 * moves a request whose submission minimum failed at that commit to `blocked`.
 *
 * This module owns everything that CHANGES a review row, or a request because of a review: the
 * start ({@link startPublicationReview}), the caps, the dispatch, the claim, the result, the
 * watchdog. How a row is read, and the SQL fragments the single-statement decisions share, live in
 * `publication-review-rows.ts`; what it all means to a person is `shared/publication-review.ts`.
 *
 * **Nothing here sends GitHub anything but the dispatch.** There is no check-run, comment, label
 * or tag, so no republish pass exists and a GitHub outage can only delay a review.
 *
 * **Nothing here trusts the dataset or the job.** The dispatch carries the review's coordinates
 * (ids, a commit, a flag, a token) and never a byte of the dataset. The report that comes back
 * goes through `parsePublicationReviewReport` before a byte is stored, the stored verdict is
 * derived from it here and never read from it, and a report whose echoed commit or release kind
 * differs from the row is refused as `report_invalid`.
 *
 * **Unknown is never green.** A review that was declined, errored or never reported is a row in
 * that state, and every reader turns a row that has not reported into a reason.
 *
 * **Every log line is ids and fixed words.** No token, nonce, secret, document text or model
 * output is ever printed.
 *
 * Two statements decide in SQL because each is one conditional write: the claim and the re-block.
 * Both read the screened commit the way the mail lease does (`screenedHeadSql`), and carry the
 * module comment of `publication-review-rows.ts` about the one place that reading can differ from
 * `readStoredReport`: a report edited by hand, which the claim then also refuses unless the edited
 * row keeps a reviewable state. That risk is accepted.
