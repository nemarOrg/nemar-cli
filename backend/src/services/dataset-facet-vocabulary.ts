/**
 * Facet vocabulary for `GET /datasets/facets` (epic #1144 phase 5a, #1170).
 *
 * Phase 4 put twenty facets on the CLI, but a user cannot discover what to
 * pass to most of them: `--task` accepts free text over 1040 distinct
 * labels, `--electrode-system` accepts six values nobody has written down
 * outside the source. This file computes the vocabulary -- distinct values
 * with counts -- for the nine keys the plan (D2) declares:
 *
 *   electrode-system, source, zarr, powerline   -- the four ENUM-kind facets
 *   bids-version, hed-version                   -- the two VERSION-kind facets
 *   license, modality, task                     -- pre-existing legacy filters
 *                                                   (never in shared/facets.ts)
 *
 * Six of the nine reuse their `shared/facets.ts` FacetKey as the response
 * key verbatim (D2's table), which is what lets the "every enum facet has a
 * vocabulary key" correspondence test walk FACETS directly rather than
 * maintaining a translation table.
 *
 * D3: `modalities`/`tasks` are comma-joined TEXT columns with no SQLite
 * split function; the catalog is 755 rows, so both are fetched in one query
 * and tallied here in JS rather than via a recursive CTE.
 *
 * D4/ADR 0005: every query here runs over `buildPublicCatalogBase("active",
 * undefined, undefined)` -- the SAME base `GET /datasets`' public branch
 * uses for an anonymous, unfiltered request (see dataset-filters.ts) -- so
 * the vocabulary can never advertise a value no list query can return.
 *
 * D5/ADR 0005: each vocabulary's query is isolated (Promise.allSettled), so
 * one failing omits only that vocabulary (and sets `warning`) rather than
 * 500ing the whole response. `modality` and `task` share one query (the
 * combined `SELECT modalities, tasks ...`), so a failure there omits BOTH
 * together -- documented, not an oversight.
