 * Identity uniqueness: one person, one account (#1254, epic #1250; ADR 0043).
 *
 * An ORCID iD, an email address (case-insensitively) or a GitHub handle may
 * back at most one LIVE account. Migration 0077 enforces the first two in the
 * database with partial unique indexes; `idx_users_github` (0012) has always
 * enforced the third. This module is the application half: the normalisation
 * every write must apply before it stores an identifier, and the pre-flight
 * lookups that turn a would-be constraint violation into a typed refusal that
 * tells the person what to do instead.
 *
 * WHY ONE MODULE. The rules were previously spelled out at each call site and
 * they disagreed. `users.email` was written verbatim by CLI signup (never
 * lowercased) and lowercased by the web routes; ORCID finalize checked
 * `oauth_identities` but not `users.orcid`; the GitHub "@" strip existed only
 * in `services/profile.ts`. Every one of those gaps is a way to end up with
 * two accounts for one person, which is what production rows 42 and 43 are.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DELETES OR MERGES. A refusal points at the account that already
 * exists; merging two accounts stays a manual, human decision.
