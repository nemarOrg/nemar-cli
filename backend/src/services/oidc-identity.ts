/**
 * Who may sign in to an OpenID Connect client (epic #2014 phase #2017; ADR 0119 rule 7), stated once.
 *
 * A client is registered with one of two rules:
 *
 *   `active_account`        the account is active (status `verified` or `approved`, ADR 0040) and
 *                           not deleted. A revoked account is not active.
 *   `person_proven_orcid`   `active_account`, AND the account's kind is `person` (ADR 0048), AND its
 *                           ORCID iD was proven by signing in with ORCID.
 *
 * "PROVEN" IS {@link ORCID_PROVEN_SQL} AND NOTHING ELSE: an `oauth_identities` row for the ORCID
 * provider whose iD is the account's `users.orcid`. NOT `users.orcid_verified`: an owner can set that
 * flag on an iD the person never signed in with (ADR 0106), and an iD filled in from a publication
 * record has neither. That is exactly the difference the rule exists for.
 *
 * The rule is applied in two places that must agree, and both read this module: the authorization
 * routes ask {@link signInRuleRefusal} of a row read with {@link ORCID_PROVEN_SQL} so the person is
 * told why, and every statement that mints (a code here; tokens in the token phase, #2018) re-applies
 * {@link signInRuleSql} in its own WHERE clause, so a change between the read and the write mints
 * nothing. The token and revocation phases (#2018, #2019) re-check the same rule at every use.
