/**
 * The compute gateway's 30-minute tick (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118): every 30 minutes, in
 * production only, take each live job one step on, retry what is owed to a finished one, and retry the
 * Tapis cancellations that people asked for.
 *
 *   `runComputeAdvanceCron`        the backstop for the webhook hints. For each live row it reads the
 *                                  job back from Tapis and applies it (`advanceComputeJob`), which
 *                                  submits a `created` job, follows a submitted one, marks one whose
 *                                  last good read is more than a day old `unreported`, and repairs a
 *                                  terminal row whose settlement or copy of its files is owed. It also
 *                                  clears the webhook nonce one day after a job is terminal, so the
 *                                  address a token in a URL belongs to stops working.
 *   `sweepComputeCancellations`    every live row with a recorded cancel is cancelled at Tapis, again
 *                                  and again until Tapis says it is over (a network call never runs
 *                                  inside a batch, so the batch records the intent and this retries).
 *
 * PRODUCTION ONLY, twice over: both are called only from the 30-minute tick's production block of
 * `scheduled()` and are absent from `DEV_CRON_ALLOWLIST`, and each refuses outside exact production by
 * itself (the dev database shares real users and the GitHub org, and development advances a job by its
 * webhook, by a read and by an administrator's command). Neither reads a switch, so a job that is
 * live is never stranded by turning compute off; the switch is read only where a job is submitted.
 * A database read of the live rows comes first: a Worker with no Tapis configuration and no jobs does
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * TEN ROWS A TICK in each of four lists (the live rows Tapis has accepted, the `created` rows still to
 * be submitted, the terminal rows owed a settlement, and those owed a copy of their files), each in
 * its own try and catch that records only a fixed word and the error's class, and one log line a tick
 * (counts and fixed words: no job output, token, name or path).
 *
 * THE ROTATION IS BY EXAMINATION, NOT BY SUCCESS. The two live lists are ordered by `examined_at`
 * (never-examined first), and every row a tick takes is stamped BEFORE its step runs, so a row that
 * cannot make progress (a job Tapis cannot be read for, a `created` job that cannot be submitted while
 * compute is off) goes to the back of the line like any other and never holds a slot for good. Ordered
 * by the last good read (`tapis_synced_at`), as the first version was, such rows kept the ten slots
 * and a healthy running job was never read. The two live lists do not share their quota, for the same
 * reason the terminal lists do not: no kind of row can starve another.
 *
 * COST, counted as subrequests (every fetch and, assumed, every D1 and R2 binding call; whether a binding
 * call counts toward the allowance is UNVERIFIED, so it is counted as if it does). A live row is one
 * Tapis read, at most two attempts of at most ten seconds each (`TICK_READ`), and a few database
 * statements: about 6, or up to about 25 for the row whose read says FINISHED, which is VERIFIED
 * before it may stand: three launcher documents, the recorded specification, the outputs listed once
 * per 1,000 declared (up to five pages at the default `maxFiles` of 5,000) and the launcher's files
 * listed once. A `created` row adds a tag search and at most one submit: about 12. A terminal row
 * owed a settlement is verified the same way (about 25); one owed a copy of its files writes at most
 * five objects, reads as many and downloads one log (two attempts at most): about 15. The worst tick
 * is ten rows of each list at its worst, about 800, against the 1,000 a paid Worker invocation may
 * make, and that allowance is shared with the rest of the 30-minute block: which is why each list is
 * capped at ten and the lists do not share a quota. A request's own reads are one attempt of at most
 * eight seconds (`REQUEST_READ`).
