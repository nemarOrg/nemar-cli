/**
 * Admin account search and the columns an admin may read (ADR 0093).
 *
 * `GET /admin/users?q=` has to look at "all fields" of an account without
 * becoming an oracle for the fields that must never be read, and it has to stay
 * true as the table grows. Both come from ONE classification of every `users`
 * column, {@link USER_COLUMN_ROLES}; the search SQL, the detail SELECT and the
 * test that fails on an unclassified column are all derived from it. A column
 * added by a migration with no entry here fails the "column classification"
 * block of `backend/test/admin-user-search-route.test.ts` until someone decides
 * what it is.
 *
 * WHY ONE HAYSTACK AND NOT A CONDITION PER COLUMN. "Is this word anywhere in the
 * account" is one expression over one lower-cased string of the searchable
 * columns, not a run of about 25 `OR`s per word. A word is looked for with
 * `instr()` rather than `LIKE`, so `%` and `_` in what the admin types are
 * ordinary characters and need no escaping. D1's limit of 100 bound parameters
 * per statement is met a different way: by numbering. A word is bound once as
 * `?N` and that placeholder is reused wherever the word appears, so a search
 * costs one parameter per word however many columns it covers.
 *
 * MATCHING. Every word must be found somewhere in the account (AND), in any
 * column, so `ada lovelace` finds given name Ada with family name Lovelace and
 * `ucsd 2026-09` finds an affiliation plus any date in September 2026 (created,
 * approved, revoked, ...). Case-insensitive for ASCII only, exactly like SQLite's
 * `LIKE`: the stored text is folded by SQLite's `lower()` and the word by the
 * same ASCII-only rule in {@link parseSearchTerms}, so `Ekström` is found by
 * `ekström` but not by `EKSTRÖM`. (When nothing matches, the close-match pass in
 * ./user-fuzzy.ts does fold accents.)
