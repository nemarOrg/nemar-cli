/**
 * Profile self-service helpers (#912), used by PATCH /auth/profile in
 * auth-web.ts. Pure functions so the semantics are unit-testable without a
 * Worker (same pattern as decideLinkOutcome / decideVerifiedFlag in
 * orcid-auth.ts).
 *
 * Field semantics, per the website Settings form (nemarOrg/website PR #144):
 *   - github_username: optional handle; empty string clears it (NULL). It is
 *     only *required* at publish time, not here. A leading "@" is stripped
 *     because people paste their handle that way.
 *   - city / country: required non-empty once submitted (US export-control
 *     screening, #835). The columns are nullable in D1 (migration 0052)
 *     for pre-existing rows; the non-empty rule lives here, at the write.
 *   - affiliation: optional free text; empty string clears it (NULL).
 *   - username: format-checked here, uniqueness and the post-approval lock
 *     checked at the route (both need the database). Added in ADR 0042 — a
 *     web/ORCID account has none, and an upload request cannot be approved
 *     without one, so this is the only way those 19 rows get a login handle.
 *     Never cleared: an empty string is a refusal, not a NULL.
 *   - given_name / family_name: accepted ONLY when the account has no verified
 *     ORCID link. NAMES STAY ORCID-CANONICAL when one is linked (#835): the
 *     record is re-read on every login and link, so a hand-edited value would
 *     be silently overwritten by the next sign-in — which is worse than
 *     refusing the edit. ADR 0041 relied on that rule and noted that ADR 0042
 *     would have to qualify it: an account whose ORCID record hides its name
 *     had no self-service fix at all, and could therefore never publish. The
 *     rule now covers exactly the accounts ORCID actually speaks for; the route
 *     answers 409 `name_is_orcid_canonical` for the rest.
