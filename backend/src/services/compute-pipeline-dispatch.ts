/**
 * The daily dispatcher of NEMAR's own pipelines (epic #2005 phase A6, #2011; ADR 0118; design section 10):
 * once a day, in production only, and only after the owner has turned two switches on, dispatch the
 * automatic recipes over the datasets they have not been run over, within the owner's caps.
 *
 * DARK BY DEFAULT, THREE TIMES OVER. It returns null outside exact production before it reads or writes
 * anything (the development database shares real users); it does nothing while
 * `COMPUTE_PIPELINES_DISPATCH_ENABLED` is not exactly `"1"` or compute is off (`computePipelinesDispatchEnabled`,
 * which reads both), touching no table; and it is wired only into the production-only daily block of
 * `scheduled()`, absent from `DEV_CRON_ALLOWLIST`. The two switches are absent from every table of
 * `backend/wrangler-sccn.toml`; the owner adds them in a reviewed change (`compute-switches-flag.test.ts`).
 *
 * WHAT IT DISPATCHES. Only recipes whose registry entry says `autoDispatch` (the service refuses a cron
 * that asks for another). For each, the eligible datasets whose newest version holds no live or succeeded
 * stamp for the recipe's tuple, through `dispatchPipelineJob`, so every dataset is decided again from its
 * own row. The stamps are synced first.
 *
 * THE CAPS, all the owner's, read from the policy on every run:
 *  - `policy.pipelines.dailyJobCap` minus the pipeline jobs already made today (UTC), across all recipes;
 *  - `policy.pipelines.maxLiveJobs` per pool, minus the pipeline jobs live in that pool, so a recipe never
 *    takes more of the cluster than the owner allows;
 *  - {@link CRON_DISPATCH_PER_TICK}, a bound of this file's own on one tick (below).
 * A refused hold stops the run for that pool: the next recipe of the same pool is not asked, because it
 * would be refused for the same reason. A refusal that would repeat for every pool (the switch off, no
 * image, no account) stops the run.
 *
 * REGISTRY DRIFT. When a job finishes, the sync compares the tuple its record names with the tuple its stamp
 * claimed. A difference holds the CLAIMED tuple (a `tuple_mismatch` stamp, `tupleHeld`): the registry is out
 * of date or the image is, and dispatching again would run the same datasets over and over under a tuple the
 * table does not name. The hold is checked on every path (`dispatchPipelineJob`, the queue, the dry run), so
 * this cron skips the recipe (`registry_drift`) and says so. It does not clear by time. It clears when the
 * registry declares another tuple (a version bump, which is never held) or when its rows are deleted, which
 * deleting the dataset they name does; the next mismatch on any dataset holds the tuple again. What remains
 * exposed are the jobs already in flight when a mismatch first appears: they finish under the same mismatch.
 *
 * COST. The daily tick shares one subrequest allowance with every daily job. The tick syncs the stamps ONCE
 * (each run over the queue is told not to sync again): at most 50 open stamps at 5 to 9 statements and calls
 * each (5 for a stamp whose job is still live: the touch, the job read, and the record reads of a finished
 * one; up to 9 when it also looks a job up by its key, rewrites its tuple and writes a hold), so 250 to
 * 450. One dispatch is about 25 (the dataset and version reads, the claim, the job's batch and records, the
 * submit), and the tick dispatches at most 10, so 250, whatever the owner's daily cap says; the queue and
 * cap reads add about 10. The bound is therefore about 510 in the usual case and 710 at the worst, counting
 * every D1 and R2 binding call as a subrequest although whether they count is UNVERIFIED, against an
 * allowance of 1,000 that the other daily jobs share. The cap is a ceiling and not a rate, and the pilot of
 * twenty datasets takes two days. Raising the bound needs a measurement first.
 *
 * NO MAIL, NO GITHUB. Nothing here imports a mail service or reaches GitHub; the only network is Tapis,
 * through the gateway's own submit.
