/**
 * What the person is told and given when a job has results (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118;
 * design section 7, "Results").
 *
 * THE MAIL LINKS TO A PAGE, NEVER TO A FILE. The "results ready" email carries one address,
 * `<APP_BASE_URL>/compute/jobs/<id>`, and nothing that would let a reader of the mail (or of a
 * forwarded copy of it) download a result: a presigned address is a bearer link, so it is made only
 * when the owner asks for it on the page (`mintResultLinks`), never put in a mail and never logged.
 * Nothing the job wrote is in the mail: not its name, its output paths or its log.
 *
 * LINKS ARE BEARER LINKS. `mintResultLinks` makes a 7-day presigned GET for each declared output of a
 * finished, verified job, only for the job's owner (the route checks), only while the objects exist
 * (a head finds them gone: `results_expired`), and at most `RESULT_LINKS_MAX` at a time. Anyone who
 * holds a link can download until it expires, and the terms say so. A link is returned to the owner and
 * never logged, never mailed and never stored.
