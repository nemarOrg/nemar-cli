/**
 * Account tiers: which statuses can use the API at all (ADR 0040, epic #1250).
 *
 * ADR 0040 fixed four statuses and their meanings:
 *   pending  - the account exists, its email is NOT verified.
 *   verified - the email is verified. THE BASE TIER: browse, dashboard,
 *              settings, CLI API key, sandbox training, request upload access.
 *              Needs no admin.
 *   approved - an admin approved the one-time upload request. Approval is the
 *              single writer of `service_access`.
 *   revoked  - access withdrawn.
 *
 * So "can this credential be used" and "may this account upload" are two
 * different questions with two different answers, and this module owns only
 * the first one. The second lives in services/upload-gate.ts and reads
 * `service_access`, never `status` (phase 1, #1251).
 *
 * Before phase 2 every authenticated path required `status = 'approved'`,
 * which is why migration 0075 must not ship without this: 0075 moves the
 * auto-approved web accounts down to `verified`/`pending`, and a middleware
 * that only knows `approved` would lock them out of the tier they now hold.

 * above so the predicate has exactly one definition. Tests import this rather
 * than re-typing the statuses: a hand-copied `IN ('verified','approved')` in a
 * test passes whatever the production query later becomes
 * (`.rules/testing.md`). The values are compile-time constants from this
 * module, never user input.

/**
 * The 403 body returned when a credential resolves to a real account that is

 *
 * `error` is the stable machine-readable half and deliberately keeps its
 * pre-ADR-0040 wording (same reasoning as SERVICE_ACCESS_ERROR in
 * upload-gate.ts): clients pattern-match on it, and no client can tell a
 * renamed string from a new failure. `message` is the human half, and it is
 * what changed: `verified` is no longer a waiting room, so the only account
 * that gets told to wait for an admin is one that has not verified its email —
 * and what it is told to do is verify the email, not wait.
