/**
 * Web-dashboard session helpers (#569).
 *
 * The dashboard authenticates via an opaque HttpOnly session cookie.
 * The CLI continues to use bearer API tokens. These helpers are shared by
 * every cookie-authenticated route — the passwordless and email-verification
 * flows and the settings endpoints in `routes/auth-web.ts`, the ORCID flow in
 * `routes/auth-orcid.ts`, `middleware/webSession.ts`, and the cookie path of
 * `middleware/auth.ts` (#572), which is how the dashboard reaches the
 * user-scoped /datasets and /users routes.
 *
 * Cookie value is 256 bits of random base64url. Only the SHA-256 hash
 * of that value lives in D1, so an exfiltrated DB cannot forge
 * cookies (256-bit preimage). The hashing is unkeyed because the
 * value's entropy is already infeasible to brute. The hashing for
 * auth codes IS keyed (HMAC-SHA256) because 6-digit codes have only
 * ~20 bits of entropy and an unkeyed at-rest hash could be
 * brute-forced offline.

 * `expires_at > datetime('now')`, and SQLite compares those two spellings as
 * TEXT: `'2026-09-10T11:07:21.484Z'` against `'2026-09-10 12:07:21'` is decided

 * bearing the same calendar date as the moment of comparison ALWAYS compared
 * greater, and a session stayed live until the next UTC midnight past its
 * nominal expiry -- up to a day of extra life on a 24-hour session, silently.
 * This is the trap ADR 0047 records for the device flow, in the table the docs
 * gate's own `DOCS_GRANT_INSERT_SQL` re-proves an app session against.
 * Migration 0084 rewrites the rows the old code left behind. Never reintroduce
 * a JS timestamp here.
 *
 * `expiresAt` is deliberately no longer returned: no caller ever read it, and

 * design here, and the two halves were each found by a separate round of review:
 *
 * - The EXPIRY and account predicates go. A docs session runs eight hours from
 *   its mint while a non-remember app session runs 24 hours from sign-in, so the
 *   windows do not nest, and keying the cascade on a live session meant signing
 *   out with a lapsed cookie answered `ok`, cleared the cookie, and left the
 *   docs session and any outstanding grant spendable.
 * - `revoked_at IS NULL` STAYS. Without it, a cookie value that had already been
 *   signed out remained a working handle for tearing down whatever docs session
 *   the account established later, and nothing prunes this table, so the handle
 *   would never expire. A revoked credential must confer nothing, including the
 *   power to revoke.
 *
 * Scope is unconstrained, which is safe rather than powerful: presenting a
 * docs- or private-scoped value here ends that same account's docs and
 * private-site access, which is what signing out is for, and nothing else (the
 * app session survives and can mint a new grant immediately), and those cookies
 * have different names on different hosts, so one cannot arrive by accident.
 *
 * NEVER use this to authenticate anything. It answers "whose unrevoked row is
 * this" and nothing about whether the row may still be used.
