/**
 * The OpenID Connect provider's configuration and its discovery document (epic #2014 phase
 * #2016; ADR 0119, decision 2).
 *
 * THE ISSUER IS `API_BASE_URL`, TRIMMED OF TRAILING SLASHES, AND NOTHING DERIVED FROM A REQUEST.
 * An identity token carries exactly that `iss`, a client trusts it for as long as it exists, and a
 * value read from the request's `Host` or from a forwarded header would let a caller choose it.
 * Each Worker's issuer is therefore its own `API_BASE_URL`: the production Worker's is the API
 * host's origin, the staging Worker's is its own, and a Worker that is reached under another name
 * answers 404 (`onOidcSurface`) rather than a document naming an issuer it is not.
 *
 * THE PROVIDER IS ON ONLY WITH A SECRET. `OIDC_SECRET` encrypts the private signing keys at rest,
 * so with none (or one under 32 characters) there is nothing safe to sign with and every OIDC
 * surface answers 404, indistinguishable from a route that does not exist.
 *
 * Pure functions of the bindings and a URL: no I/O, so the tables here are unit-testable without
 * instantiating the Worker, as `cors-origins.ts` is.
