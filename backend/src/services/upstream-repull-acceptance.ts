/**
 * An administrator's acceptance of a re-pull's squash merge made without its trailers (epic #1046;
 * ADR 0111, the amendment of 2026-10-29; issue #1996), and the one ledger line NEMAR writes for it.
 *
 *   POST /admin/repulls/:id/merge-trailers/accept   { pr, merge_sha, reason? }
 *
 * NEMAR's merge gate writes a re-pull's squash message so that its last paragraph is the re-pull
 * commit's trailers; the privacy ledger's fresh-clone proof (ADR 0085) reads the merge as the
 * re-pull's own commit only then. A merge made outside the gate (GitHub's merge button) has none,
 * `resume` refuses its release (`merge-trailers`), and rewriting `main` is no repair: the tag, a
 * minted DOI and public clones name the commit. So an administrator may accept the merge, and the
 * acceptance is earned by what the Worker reads on GitHub with its own credential, never by the
 * reason or by the caller's word. In this order, the first that does not hold refuses with its
 * word and writes nothing:
 *  1. The record at `merged` (`n0`) or `patch_merged` (`n1`) (`bad-transition`), its merge commit
 *     the one named (`merge-mismatch`); a record an administrator opened (`accept-automatic`: the
 *     automatic path's merges are the Worker's, written with the trailers), and opened by this
 *     administrator (`accept-not-yours`).
 *  2. The recorded pull request, read on GitHub: the record's number, its release branch into
 *     `main` of the dataset's own repository (`readRecordedPullRequest`, `pull-request-mismatch`),
 *     merged, with GitHub's merge commit the record's (`merge-mismatch`), at the recorded head or
 *     one GitHub's comparison shows moved from it only on paths enrichment writes
 *     (`merge-head-foreign`).
 *  3. The merge commit, read on GitHub: one parent (`merge-not-squash`), which is the record's base
 *     or a descendant of it moved only on paths enrichment writes (`merge-parent-foreign`).
 *  4. Its tree, the same as the record's commit outside `.nemar/**` and `.github/**`: N.0.0's
 *     synthesized tree, N.0.1's gated head (`merge-tree-mismatch`; `tree-anchor-missing` for an
 *     N.0.1 merged before its gates were recorded, which the release cannot compare either), the
 *     comparison the release makes for the tag, read from the two root trees.
 *  5. What it did to the privacy ledger: nothing, or appended scrub lines and edited none before
 *     them; and, when the proof needs the line, a `repull-scrubbed` line whose `scanner` a ledger
 *     line can carry (`merge-ledger-foreign` otherwise).
 *  6. `main` still holds the merge (`merge-not-on-main`); and, when the line is needed, a ledger
 *     on `main` (`ledger-missing-on-main`) that names the merge in no line yet, since NEMAR writes
 *     only after it records (`attestation-conflict`).
 * Then the acceptance is recorded with its reason (one row, `upstream_repull_merge_acceptances`,
 * and an audit row, `repull_merge_trailers_accepted`), once: a second request for the same merge
 * replays it and writes no second row, its reason not needed; for another merge it is refused.
 *
 * THE ATTESTATION. When the merge appended a `repull-scrubbed` line beside other files, the one
 * shape the proof needs it for, the Worker appends to the ledger on `main` one line naming the
 * merge commit (`shared/repull-merge-acceptance.ts`), in a commit of its own through the Contents
 * API (`upstream-repull-acceptance-github.ts`), leased on the ledger blob it read, so a line another
 * writer appended in between is never dropped: GitHub refuses the write and it is read again.
 * Every request, a replay included, reads `main`'s ledger first: a line already there is seen and
 * not written again; a missing one is written, once more, only while `main` still holds the merge.
 * The line is a function of the stored acceptance, so a write whose answer was lost is found, and
 * a line on `main` naming this merge that is not NEMAR's bytes is `attestation-conflict`, never
 * overwritten. The release is refused until the Worker reads the line on `main` itself
 * (`acceptance-unattested`, `upstream-repull-verified.ts`).
 *
 * Nothing here moves the record, merges, tags or mails anyone. The reason never leaves NEMAR's
 * database: the ledger refuses free text by design (ADR 0085, ADR 0036).
