/**
 * The compute gateway's job index and the one function that makes a job (epic #2005 phase A3, #2008;
 * ADR 0118, decisions 2, 3 and 9; design sections 5, 7 and 9).
 *
 * `createJob` validates a job, takes its hold and writes its index row in ONE batch, and only after
 * the batch has committed writes the job's records. Nothing submits to Tapis here: that is phase A5.
 *
 * THE RULES, each one deliberate:
 *  - A JOB AND ITS HOLD ARE ONE BATCH. The batch is the ledger's own hold statement
 *    (`holdStatements`, which carries the person's live-job limit as a guard READ INSIDE THE SAME
 *    STATEMENT, so two requests racing for the last slot cannot both win), then the pseudonym's
 *    `INSERT OR IGNORE`, then the job's INSERT, each of the last two gated on `EXISTS` of the hold row
 *    of this job. A refused hold therefore writes nothing at all: no job row, no ledger entry, no
 *    pseudonym. `changes` of the first statement says whether the hold was taken, and the reason is read
 *    after the refusal (`holdRefusalReason`), never decided by a second hold attempt.
 *  - A JOB ID HAS ONE HOLD FOR EVER (a partial unique index of the ledger enforces it): a job id is new
 *    for every request, so a resubmission is a new job; the hold's key is the job's (`holdKey`), so
 *    nobody picks one.
 *  - A RETRY FINDS ITS JOB. A request that carries an idempotency key and has a job under
 *    `(account, key)` returns that job, however its policy has changed since; the same key for another
 *    request is an error, never an answer with the first job (`ComputeJobError`, `idempotency_conflict`),
 *    because the caller would believe its other request was accepted. Two requests with one key racing
 *    each reach the batch, and the unique index refuses the second as a whole (a batch is one
 *    transaction): it then finds the first's job.
 *  - RECORDS ARE WRITTEN AFTER THE COMMIT, NEVER BEFORE: a bucket lock would make an orphan record for
 *    a refused job permanent. `records_written_at` is set when the job's own records have landed (for a
 *    job that uploads a code bundle or a partner's files, `finalizeBundle` or `finalizeSubmittedFiles`
 *    sets it, after the copy), and phase A5 refuses to
 *    submit without it. A write that fails after the commit leaves the job and its hold, says so
 *    (`recordsWritten: false`, one log line with the job id and a fixed word), and a replay of the same
 *    key writes what is missing; it never rewrites a record.
 *  - D1 JOB ROWS CARRY THE ACCOUNT ID AND FIXED WORDS ONLY. Identity is in `identity.json`, in the
 *    records bucket, and nowhere else. A log line carries a job id and a fixed word, never a path a
 *    person chose.
 *  - THE SPECIFICATION IS VALIDATED BEFORE ANY HOLD EXISTS: the schema, the dataset version tags that
 *    a launch needs (`datasetVersionWithoutTag`, `launchSpecFits`), the owner's per-job ceilings and the
 *    partitions offered to people, and the bundle's size. A refusal there is `invalid_spec`,
 *    `over_job_limit`, `partition_not_offered` or `bundle_too_large`, and writes nothing. What a route
 *    adds (runtime availability, the registries an image may come from, which datasets are eligible) is
 *    the route's.
 *  - `spec_digest` is the SHA-256 of the exact bytes of `records/<id>/spec.json`: the text is made once,
 *    before the INSERT, and the same text is written after the commit. It records what was ASKED FOR and
 *    never the launch specification, which carries a token. For a person's or a pipeline's job the text
 *    is the validated specification; for a PARTNER's job it is the partner's own hold body, byte for
 *    byte as it was sent (`holdBody`), so a respelled body is another request, and only the small fields
 *    a hold needs (`PartnerHoldBodySchema`) are read from it. A hold body is not a job specification,
 *    so none of the launch rules (the schema, `launchSpecFits`, the bundle) apply to it.
 *  - THE GATEWAY PSEUDONYM is `gw_` and 20 lowercase base32 characters, RANDOM, stored in
 *    `compute_gateway_users` on an account's first job and copied to every job of that account, never
 *    rotated and never reused. It is random and stored, not derived from a key: a derived value would
 *    change if the key were rotated. NEMAR's own pipeline jobs carry the literal `nemar-pipelines`.
 *  - The pipelines' own caps (a daily count and a live count per pool) are the dispatch phase's, not a
 *    person's limit: a pipeline job is held on the platform `pipelines` pool, names no budget, and meets
 *    no per-person guard.
