/**
 * The identifier screen of a publication request (epic #1610, phase 4).
 *
 * When a depositor requests publication, the Worker hands the dataset to the
 * `run-identifier-screen` workflow on `nemarDatasets/.github`, which screens it
 * for identifying information (names, birth dates and record numbers in EDF/BDF
 * headers, identifying sidecar columns and keys, identifying file names) and
 * posts a report to `/webhooks/identifier-screen-result`. The admin's
 * publication-request email WAITS for that report and states it.
 *
 * Every way of not getting a report still reaches the admin, and says so:
 *   - the dispatch was impossible (no credential, callback secret, API base or
 *     repository): stored `error` / `dispatch-unconfigured`, mailed at once;
 *   - GitHub refused or the call failed: `error` / `dispatch-failed`, mailed at once;
 *   - the workflow posted an error, or a body outside the report contract:
 *     `error`, mailed when it lands;
 *   - the workflow never reported: GitHub answers a dispatch 204 even when no
 *     workflow listens for the event, so a 2xx proves nothing. The watchdog
 *     ({@link sweepIdentifierScreens}) turns a screen still pending after
 *     {@link SCREEN_REPORT_DEADLINE_MINUTES} into `unreported` and mails it.
 * Unknown is never healthy (ADR 0053): none of those is described, stored or
 * gated as clean (`screenGate` answers "rerun").
 *
 * **Nothing a workflow wrote reaches D1, an email, a log line or an API response
 * except through `parseScreenReport` and `describeScreen`**
 * (`shared/identifier-screen-report.ts`). The stored report is the parsed one,
 * re-serialized; a body that does not parse is replaced by a Worker-built error
 * report and only the parser's fixed error word is logged.
 *
 * The routes stay thin; this module owns the logic: starting a screen
 * ({@link startIdentifierScreen}), storing a result ({@link storeScreenResult}),
 * mailing it exactly once ({@link notifyAdminsOfScreen}), the watchdog, the
 * block on direct identifiers, and the approval gate ({@link checkApprovalScreenGate}).
