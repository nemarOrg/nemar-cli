/**
 * The observer: Expanse's own accounting, posted to NEMAR, and the final settlement it makes possible
 * (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118, decision 8; design sections 5 and 8).
 *
 * A small posting service runs on the cluster, summarizes the queue per partition (every 15 minutes) and,
 * once a day, exports `sacct` for the community account, and posts a `nemar.observation.v1` document to
 * `POST /compute/observer` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, a token valid for ONE run. The Worker
 * adopted the observer's document as it is (`shared/contract/compute-observation.ts`; the mapping to the
 * rows below is `./compute-observation.ts`). This module mints that token, takes the post, and settles
 * jobs against it.
 *
 *   `mintObserverRun`      an administrator mints a one-hour run; the token is `<run id>.<digest>`
 *   `ingestObserverPost`   the one post a run may make: the snapshots and the rows are stored, then the
 *                          jobs that can be settled are
 *   `settleObservedRows`   match stored rows to jobs by Slurm id and settle the ones whose job has ended
 *
 * THE OBSERVER IS AN UNSIGNED SENDER. It holds one token for one run: an HMAC (domain tag
 * `compute-observer`) over the run id and the run's own nonce, so nothing it posts is trusted beyond its
 * bounds. The token is checked in constant time against the run row; a wrong, an expired and a reused
 * token get ONE refusal, the same status and body, and a refusal writes nothing. The run is spent by
 * one conditional UPDATE made BEFORE anything is stored, so two posts racing make one. The body is
 * bounded (1 MiB and 5,000 rows) and every row is validated to the shape of its column; a row that is
 * not valid refuses the post, and the run is NOT spent by a body that failed validation (the check runs
 * first), so the observer can post again.
 *
 * FINAL SETTLEMENT. A row matches the job whose `slurm_job_id` it carries. When that job has ended and
 * has a provisional charge and no final one, the job is settled to Expanse's figure through the ledger's
 * `settleFinal` (one `adjust`, once per job): the row's own `charged_milli` when it sent one, else the
 * figure the rate table gives for the allocation it reports (`suMilliFor`, per node: the row's CPUs,
 * memory and GPUs are totals). A difference within the policy's tolerance (`settle.toleranceMilli`, or
 * `settle.tolerancePercent` of the provisional charge) is routine and silent; a larger one sets
 * `flag_mismatch` and the job is STILL settled to Expanse's figure. A job that skipped the reservation
 * (`flag_unreserved`) has no hold, so `settleFinal` has nothing to correct: its row is matched and
 * listed, and an administrator moves the charge by an `adjust` entry if it is warranted. A row whose
 * job has not ended waits (`applied_at` stays NULL), and the daily sweep tries it again; a row that
 * can never settle is judged once (`applied_at` set, the job flagged) and never tried again.
 * Rows that match no job stay `matched_job_id` NULL and are listed to the administrators.
