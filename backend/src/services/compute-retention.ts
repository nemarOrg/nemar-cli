/**
 * The retention sweep (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118, decision 9 and the amendment of 2026-11-04;
 * design section 9): NEMAR keeps compute records only as long as policy says, and says how many it let go.
 *
 * Daily, in production only, `runComputeRetentionSweep` does five things, each bounded:
 *
 *  1. RECORDS. For a terminal job past `retention_until` with no legal hold (a job hold, or a hold on its
 *     account), it deletes `records/<id>/` and `logs/<id>/` through the binding, then reduces the index row
 *     to anonymous counts (`account_id`, `tapis_owner`, `gateway_user` and `idempotency_key` become NULL).
 *  2. LOGS. For a terminal job with no flag and no hold, `logs/<id>/` is deleted once `retention.logsDays`
 *     have passed since `ended_at` (a flagged job keeps its logs with its records, design section 9).
 *  3. RESULTS. Results expire by the results bucket's own lifecycle rule, so this only reconciles: a job's
 *     `jobs/<id>/` objects still present a day after `retention.resultsDays` are deleted and counted `late`.
 *     A hold NEVER keeps a result (a result is the person's, not a record).
 *  4. IDENTIFIERS. A deleted account's pools and the ledger entries it acted on are reduced to anonymous
 *     counts, through the one exception migration 0130 makes (the holder reference and the actor, nothing
 *     else), once none of its jobs remain with its number and nothing is open or held.
 *  5. HOUSEKEEPING. Observer runs past their hour are `expired`, and queue snapshots older than 90 days go.
 *
 * THE RULES.
 *  - A BUCKET LOCK IS NEVER BYPASSED BY CODE. The sweep never changes a lock, a rule or a bucket setting; a
 *    lifecycle rule cannot delete a locked object, so this sweep is what deletes records, and it only ever
 *    asks the binding to delete. ANY refusal on a `records/` or `logs/` key is counted `locked`, whatever its
 *    text (the text of R2's refusal is not verified), the job is left whole, and the next day asks again;
 *    a job that was refused is stamped (`retention_attempted_at`) and goes to the back of the line, so ten
 *    jobs whose locks have not lapsed cannot hold every newer one.
 *  - A LIVE JOB IS NEVER TOUCHED: only terminal states are listed.
 *  - A HOLD IS A D1 FLAG THE SWEEP HONOURS (R2 has no per-object hold), read in the candidate query AND
 *    again immediately before a job's objects are deleted.
 *  - DELETION AT PERIOD END IS BY COUNT, LOGGED, NEVER PER JOB: one audit row of counts and one log line.
 *    The sweep never logs a job id, an account or a key.
 *  - IT NEVER RUNS OUTSIDE EXACT PRODUCTION, and it reads no compute switch: a record that is due goes
 *    whether or not compute is on.
