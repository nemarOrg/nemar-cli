/**
 * The statements behind the back-channel logout deliveries (epic #2014 phase #2019; ADR 0119 rule
 * 15; migration 0124): what is due, the claim of an attempt, what an attempt records, and what the
 * owner reads. The sender is `services/oidc-logout.ts`; the rows are QUEUED by the cascade
 * (`OIDC_ENQUEUE_LOGOUTS_SQL` in `services/oidc-cascade.ts`), inside the batch that ends the grants.
 *
 * EVERY TIME IS D1'S, in the statement: `datetime('now')` and a modifier bound as seconds, never a JS
 * `toISOString()` (the two compare unequally on the same day, the trap ADR 0047 records), so a row's
 * `next_attempt_at` and the question "is it due" are measured by one clock.
 *
 * AN ATTEMPT IS CLAIMED BEFORE IT IS MADE, and its answer is recorded only by the attempt that holds the
 * claim. The claim moves `next_attempt_at` to the end of a lease (`OIDC_LOGOUT_LEASE_SECONDS`), counts
 * the attempt and stamps the `jti` of the token about to be sent, all in one conditional UPDATE whose
 * `meta.changes` is the winner test: of two runners that read the same due row (the first attempt after
 * a commit and the retry tick, or two ticks) exactly one sends. The record then names that `jti`, so an
 * attempt that outlived its lease cannot overwrite the answer of a newer one. An attempt that never
 * records, because the isolate was evicted, is taken up again when its lease lapses; it was counted when
 * it was claimed, so the retries stay bounded.
