/**
 * Weekly import summary DECISIONS and report body (epic #1306 phase 4, #1312).
 * Pure, no I/O.
 *
 * ## Why an unconditional report
 *
 * Phases 1-3 made the pipeline able to describe its own state. This phase makes
 * someone read it.
 *
 * An alarm fires only when a threshold trips, and the seven-week outage produced
 * no alarm because no threshold existed. A report that appears only when something
 * breaks cannot distinguish a healthy week from a broken reporter -- both look like
 * silence. So this arrives every week whether or not anything is wrong, which is
 * what makes "no news" mean something.
 *
 * ## Unknown is a value, and it is not zero
 *
 * The rule this phase turns on. "0 imports" and "no data about imports" looked alike,
 * and that is how the original incident stayed invisible: a dashboard full of zeroes
 * reads as a quiet week. So every count here is `number | null`, and `null` renders as
 * `unknown`.
 *
 * Every COUNT goes through one renderer ({@link count}), because a ternary per field is
 * how one of them eventually renders `0`. The handful of non-count fields -- the two
 * booleans and the dispatch phrase -- necessarily have their own three-way rendering,
 * and review found three of them unpinned, so each now has its own test: a
 * `dispatchLost === null` that rendered as `yes` is "the reporter could not see, and
 * said everything is fine", which is the founding failure exactly.
 */

/**
 * Rows to name before falling back to a count.
 *
 * The spirit of ADR 0036 -- an operational record carries counts and pointers, not an
 * unbounded dump -- though note 0036 is stricter than this about truncation
 * specifically. What it forbids is inlining detail that belongs elsewhere; a bounded
 * list plus an explicit "and N more" is a pointer, and the count above it is never
 * truncated.

 * regex.
 *
 * ISO weeks start on Monday and week 1 is the week containing the first Thursday
 * of January -- equivalently, the week containing January 4th. The consequence
 * that makes this worth its own function and its own boundary tests: the ISO year
 * is NOT always the calendar year. 2027-01-01 is a Friday, so it belongs to
 * 2026-W53; 2024-12-30 is a Monday, so it belongs to 2025-W01. Deriving the label
 * from `getUTCFullYear()` would mislabel both, and a mislabelled week silently
 * breaks the title-as-dedup-key: two different weeks could claim one title, or one
 * week could be filed twice under two.
