/**
 * The compute gateway's two dark switches (epic #2005 phase A4, #2009; ADR 0118 decision 8).
 *
 * Nothing here acts. These readers say whether a Worker job may act, and each job that reads them
 * reads at CALL time (a binding changed in a test changes the answer; nothing is cached at module
 * load). The rules, each one deliberate:
 *
 *  - Compute runs only in exactly `production` or exactly `development`. No trim, no case fold, and an
 *    unset binding is neither, so a binding that went missing or was misspelled can never turn
 *    compute on. Development is allowed so staging can run compute against a development tenant with
 *    its own credentials; every compute SCHEDULE stays production-only (the cron allowlist), and in
 *    development a job advances by its webhook, by a read, and by an administrator's command.
 *  - A switch is on only as the exact string `"1"` (as `AUTO_REPULL_ENABLED`). `"true"`, `" 1"`, `"yes"`
 *    and an unset binding are off.
 *  - The pipelines switch acts only while the compute switch is also on, so turning compute off stops
 *    NEMAR's own dispatch whatever the second switch says.
 *
 * Both names are absent from every table of `backend/wrangler-sccn.toml`; the owner adds them in a
 * reviewed change (`compute-switches-flag.test.ts` pins that).
