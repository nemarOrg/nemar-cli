/**
 * Who holds a support ticket, who may see one, and what removing a person does to both
 * (epic #1893 phase 3, #1896).
 *
 * Three things live here because they must agree:
 *   - {@link resolveAssignee}: one function applies a queue's strategy, away windows and the
 *     eligibility rules;
 *   - {@link ticketVisibleTo}: the one SQL predicate the admin API (phase 3b) puts in every read
 *     and write, so a restricted ticket is never reachable by a path that forgot the rule;
 *   - {@link mailReleaseStatements}: what a demotion, a revocation or a soft delete does to a
 *     removed person's tickets, availability and queue references.
 *
 * Access follows the account's role and the per-ticket exclusion, and nothing else. An admin is
 * an admin whether a person or an agent holds the account; no rule below reads the account kind
 * or the username.
