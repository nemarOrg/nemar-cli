/**
 * The launcher's outputs and complete steps (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118; design section 7,
 * "The launcher on Expanse" and "Results"): what happens between a launcher declaring its results and
 * the Worker letting a Tapis `FINISHED` stand.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE POINT. No upload address is issued before every check has passed:
 *  1. the request is a valid `OutputsRequest` (closed, the contract's own path predicate, each launcher
 *     file named once, no path twice);
 *  2. the number of outputs is within the policy's `resultLimits.maxFiles` (`too_many_outputs`);
 *  3. no file is over `RESULT_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (5 GB, until presigned multipart is verified on R2) and
 *     the whole is within the job limit `resultLimits.maxJobBytes` (`results_too_large`);
 *  4. the bytes are CLAIMED in ONE conditional UPDATE of `results_bytes` whose WHERE holds the person's
 *     share and the platform's total (`results_quota_exceeded`): the two sums are read INSIDE the
 *     statement that writes, so two jobs racing for the last bytes cannot both win. (Reading a sum in
 *     one query and writing in another is the mistake that statement exists to prevent.) A job with no
 *     account has no person's share, and the platform total still applies. The quota counts a job's bytes
 *     until its results have expired (the job ended longer ago than the policy's results retention).
 * `limits.max_total_bytes` of the launch specification bounds the dataset selection and is NOT this
 * limit: the per-job results limit is the policy's own, and the two numbers are never one.
 *
 * A REFUSAL records itself: the word is written as the job's `failure_detail` (a conditional UPDATE that
 * never replaces one already there, so the first refusal is the reason), the launcher's four own files
 * are STILL presigned (its result and log are how the failure is explained), and the job then ends
 * `result_upload_failed`, charged, because the submitter caused it (`isPlatformFailure` knows each).
 * The launcher then asks again with no outputs, which is accepted: the declared file and the claimed bytes
 * are those of the launcher's four files alone, and no quota is applied to them (they are small, NEMAR's
 * own, and the job is already failing); `failure_detail` is never cleared. A request that names outputs
 * after a refusal is refused again with the recorded word.
 *
 * `declared.json` (under the job's prefix, outside the two prefixes an address is signed for) is written
 * through the binding after the claim, and is what `complete` and the verification read. A replay of the
 * same request re-presigns and changes nothing; another body for a job that has claimed is `bad_state`.
 * Addresses live one hour and are asked for again after expiry, never after `complete` (a holder of the
 * token could otherwise overwrite objects with same-size content before verification).
 *
 * `complete` lists the declared objects (not one head each: a job may declare thousands, and a Worker
 * invocation makes a bounded number of subrequests) and answers 409 `results_incomplete`, retryable, for
 * a missing or short one; it sets `outputs_completed_at` once and is idempotent.
