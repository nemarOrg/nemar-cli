/**
 * Back-channel logout: telling a client that an account's grants ended (epic #2014 phase #2019; ADR
 * 0119 rule 15; OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0).
 *
 * THE INTENT IS A ROW, THE CALL IS HERE. The cascade (`services/oidc-cascade.ts`) writes one
 * `oidc_logout_deliveries` row per client that registered an address, inside the batch that ends the
 * grants. Nothing in that batch touches the network: a partner's server must never be able to slow,
 * fail or block a revocation, and a delivery that fails never undoes one. This file sends what the
 * rows say, afterwards: once from `waitUntil` right after the commit
 * ({@link deferLogoutDelivery}), and again from the production-only retry tick every half hour
 * ({@link runOidcLogoutRetryTick}), on the schedule in `OIDC_LOGOUT_RETRY_DELAYS_SECONDS`.
 *
 * THE MAIN RISK SURFACE is that this is the Worker making an OUTBOUND request to an address somebody
 * else chose, so every rule below is a fence:
 *   - ONLY THE ADDRESS THE REGISTRY VALIDATED. The owner registers it (`validateClientInput`: https,
 *     canonical, no user information, and in production a named host and not a loopback or an IP
 *     literal), the table CHECKs `https://`, and {@link logoutAddressVerdict} asks again at send time,
 *     because a row is read at send time and not at registration. An address that fails is recorded
 *     `failed` (`address_refused`) and never requested.
 *   - OUTSIDE PRODUCTION NOTHING REACHES A REAL HOST. The dev Worker shares real accounts and a
 *     partner's address may be a real host, so a delivery is sent only to a loopback address or a host
 *     the owner listed in `OIDC_LOGOUT_DEV_HOSTS`, and is otherwise recorded `fenced`. The fence fails
 *     closed the other way from `isNonProductionEnv`: only ENVIRONMENT exactly `production` sends to an
 *     arbitrary https host, so an unset or mistyped value is fenced.
 *   - NEVER FOLLOW A REDIRECT. `redirect: "manual"`: a 3xx is the answer, recorded `failed`
 *     (`redirect`), because the signed token is for the registered address and for no other.
 *   - BOUNDED TIME AND SIZE. {@link OIDC_LOGOUT_TIMEOUT_MS} for the whole exchange, an answer's body is
 *     never read (it is cancelled), and what is sent is one short form field.
 *   - NOTHING BUT THE SIGNED TOKEN GOES OUT: no `Authorization`, no cookie, no client secret, no API
 *     key. A logout token proves itself by its signature, which the partner checks against the key set.
 *   - ATTEMPTS ARE BOUNDED AND RECORDED: one, and five retries (1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2
 *     hours, 12 hours), then `failed`. A 5xx, a 408, a 429, a timeout and a network failure are
 *     retried; any other 4xx, a redirect and any other answer are not (retrying a refusal does not
 *     change it). A 408 or 429 may carry a `Retry-After`, which is read as a LOWER bound for the wait
 *     (the longer of it and the schedule's, at most 12 hours), so a partner can slow a delivery and can
 *     never add an attempt. What is recorded is a status and a fixed word
 *     (`OIDC_LOGOUT_ERROR_CLASSES`), never the text of an error or of an answer.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE, said plainly: the sender does not resolve a name itself, so a registered
 * name that a partner points at an address of its own choosing is still requested. That is the partner's
 * own server by definition, and the request carries nothing but a token that names that partner as its
 * audience. A Worker has no route to a private network, and an IP literal is refused in production.
 *
 * THE TOKEN is a JWT, ES256 under the current key (the one the identity tokens use), header `typ:
 * logout+jwt` (RFC 8725 explicit typing), claims `iss`, `aud` (the client's public id), `iat`, `exp` (two
 * minutes), a `jti` that is new for every attempt (so a retry is a new token and never a replay of the
 * old), `sub`, and `events` holding the back-channel logout event with an empty object. No `nonce` (the
 * specification forbids one) and no `sid` (NEMAR keeps no session id for a client to correlate).
