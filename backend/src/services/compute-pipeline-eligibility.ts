/**
 * Which datasets NEMAR's own pipelines may process (epic #2005 phase A6, #2011; ADR 0065; ADR 0118).
 *
 * ONE predicate, written once as a list of named terms, each with its SQL and its TypeScript form side
 * by side, so the query that selects candidates and the check that re-confirms a row cannot drift
 * apart: a test drives the same generated rows through both and fails on any disagreement. The shape is
 * `neurobagel-eligibility.ts`'s, deliberately; the two predicates are separate because what federates
 * and what is processed are different decisions.
 *
 * DECIDED FROM THE D1 ROW on every dispatch, never from the request and never from a value a caller
 * supplied (ADR 0065): the anonymity term reads the stored `anonymous` column and nothing else. A
 * dataset is eligible when it is:
 *   - active (`status`), public (`visibility`), and NOT anonymous (`anonymous = 0`; NULL is unknown,
 *     and unknown is not false);
 *   - first published (`first_published_at`), not withdrawn (`withdrawn_at`), and its concept DOI not
 *     tombstoned (`ezid_status` is not `unavailable`);
 *   - holding at least one `dataset_versions` row;
 *   - an EEG dataset: `eeg` is a WHOLE token of its comma-separated `modalities` (the whole-token clause
 *     of `dataset-filters.ts`, so `ieeg` is not `eeg`);
 *   - a real dataset: an `nm` id below the reserved fixture band (ADR 0068) or an `on` OpenNeuro
 *     mirror, and neither a sandbox nor an exemplar row.
 *
 * "Deleted" is not a separate term: deleting a dataset removes its row, and a row with
 * `status = 'deleted'` fails the `active` term.
 *
 * The SQL names a term's literals inline and binds nothing, so a statement that embeds the predicate
 * binds only its own parameters. Embed it; never copy it.
