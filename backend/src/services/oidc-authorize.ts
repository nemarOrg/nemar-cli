/**
 * The authorization endpoint's decisions (epic #2014 phase #2017; ADR 0119, rules 2, 3, 7 and 8).
 *
 * The page at `app.nemar.org/oauth/authorize` forwards an authorization request here, through the
 * check and consent routes (`routes/auth-oidc.ts`), and renders or follows the answer. EVERYTHING
 * IS DECIDED HERE, in one order that every request walks the same way:
 *
 *   1. THE CLIENT AND THE REDIRECT ADDRESS. An unknown or disabled client, a missing or repeated
 *      `client_id` or `redirect_uri`, or a redirect address that is not, character for character, one
 *      the client registered, is an ERROR PAGE. Nothing before this step can be trusted to say where
 *      to send the person, so nothing before it ever redirects (RFC 6749 section 4.1.2.1).
 *   2. THE REQUEST. From here on an error OF THE REQUEST is a REDIRECT to that registered address
 *      carrying `error`, the request's `state` and `iss` (RFC 9207): a repeated parameter, `request` or
 *      `request_uri`, a missing response type (`invalid_request`) or one other than `code`
 *      (`unsupported_response_type`: there is no implicit grant, ADR 0119 rule 1), a response mode
 *      other than `query`, a PKCE method other than S256 or no challenge, an unreadable `prompt`,
 *      `max_age` or `nonce`, and the scopes (`openid` missing, a catalogue scope the client may not
 *      have, or a machine-only scope: `invalid_scope`; a name outside the catalogue is dropped).
 *   3. THE SESSION. Only an app session read under the `__Host-` cookie name may approve a grant
 *      (ADR 0119 rule 10); the route passes no session otherwise. None: sign in (`prompt=none`:
 *      `login_required`).
 *   4. FRESHNESS. `prompt=login`, a `max_age` the session is older than, or a valid `id_token_hint`
 *      for another subject: sign in again (`prompt=none`: `login_required`). The sign-in the page sent
 *      the person to satisfies all three, and is recognized by a SIGNED marker (below), never by a
 *      value a caller can write. Front-channel freshness is a courtesy: a client relies on the
 *      identity token's `auth_time`, which the code carries.
 *   5. THE CLIENT'S SIGN-IN RULE (`services/oidc-identity.ts`). Refused: a page that says why and
 *      links back to the client with `access_denied` (`prompt=none`: the `access_denied` redirect).
 *   6. CONSENT. A client is first-party only while EVERY redirect address it registered still passes
 *      `isFirstPartyRedirect`, re-asked now; a client registered first-party whose addresses no longer
 *      qualify is treated as third-party and asked, as any other client is. A third-party client is
 *      asked under its `consent_mode`: `ask_once` asks unless a grant the PERSON gave covers every
 *      scope asked for, `always` asks every time, and so does `prompt=consent` (which a first-party
 *      client ignores). (`prompt=none`: `consent_required`.)
 *   7. THE CODE. 256 random bits, stored only as its hash, for 60 seconds by D1's clock. The
 *      statement that writes it re-reads the session, the account, the client, the sign-in rule, the
 *      redirect address and the grant in its own WHERE clause, so a change since step 1 mints nothing,
 *      and a mint that wrote nothing is an error page, never a redirect.
 *
 * THE CONSENT TOKEN is what proves the person's answer came from a screen this API showed to THIS
 * session for THIS request: an HMAC-SHA256 under `OIDC_SECRET`, over a domain tag and the session,
 * the client, the redirect address, the scope set, `state`, the PKCE challenge, `nonce` and an expiry
 * ten minutes after the check by D1's clock. The consent route walks steps 1 to 6 again and then
 * verifies the token against what it finds, so a token for another session, another request or a
 * past moment is refused, and an answer is never taken for a request the check did not show.
 *
 * THE SIGN-IN MARKER is the same kind of proof for the other half of the flow: when the check sends a
 * person to sign in for a request that asks for a fresh sign-in, the request it returns carries
 * `nemar_auth_after=<unix>.<mac>`, an HMAC-SHA256 under `OIDC_SECRET` with its own domain tag over the
 * moment (D1's clock) and the client, good for ten minutes. A marker that does not verify is treated
 * as absent, so `prompt=login` and `max_age` still apply to a request a caller wrote by hand.
 *
 * `client_id` IN `oidc_grants` AND `oidc_codes` IS THE `oidc_clients.id` ROW ID, NOT THE PUBLIC
 * `oc_...` STRING (migration 0122). The public identifier appears here only as `ClientRow.client_id`
 * and in the statements' `c.client_id = ?` joins.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE LOGS a `state`, a code, a nonce or the request.
