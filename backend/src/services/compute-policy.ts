/**
 * The compute gateway's owner policy (epic #2005 phase A2, #2007; ADR 0118).
 *
 * The policy is one immutable row per version in `compute_policy` (migration 0114); the current
 * policy is the highest version, and no row means `DEFAULT_COMPUTE_POLICY` of
 * shared/contract/compute.ts. Everything the owner sets without a deploy lives in it.
 *
 * THE RULES, each one deliberate:
 *  - The write path is `putPolicy` and nothing else. It checks the strict `ComputePolicySchema`
 *    (a mistyped or unknown key is refused, never stripped), checks in the same statement that the
 *    account is an owner (so no caller, whatever route it came through, writes a version without
 *    one), and writes the version and its audit row in one batch, so a version never exists
 *    unaudited. The audit row is the shape of the event (who and which version), never the policy.
 *  - The read path is strict too, and fails closed. `getPolicy` parses a stored row with the same
 *    strict schema and throws `ComputePolicyUnreadable` for one it cannot parse; it never falls
 *    back to the default for a row that exists (the default applies only when there is no row at
 *    all), because a corrupt row read as the default would quietly reopen limits the owner closed.
 *    A new policy key is therefore added as OPTIONAL, so an older stored row keeps parsing.
 *  - Nothing here is a response schema. The CLI parses the route's answer with the open schema of
 *    shared/contract/compute-admin.ts; this file never serves a client's parse.
 *  - An issue names a field and a zod code and never a value. A field name that is not a plain
 *    identifier (a key of the partner-client record the caller chose) is `?`.
