/**
 * Service-access upload gate (website ADR 0010, #1013; ADR 0040, #1250).
 *
 * Real (non-sandbox) uploads are gated on `service_access` — the admin-granted
 * permission to consume compute/storage, issued only after export-control review
 * of the person's GitHub + location/affiliation. ADR 0040 made admin approval
 * the single writer of it, so an account at the base tier (`verified`) never
 * holds it and `status='approved'` always does. Sandbox uploads are exempt (they
 * are the capped training playground).
 *
 * The gate reads `service_access`, never `status`, which is what let phase 2
 * widen every authenticated path to `verified` without widening upload.
 *
 * Phase 2 adds the CHANNEL to the create-time gate. Sandbox training is a CLI
 * exercise — `nemar sandbox` drives a real create/upload/finalize cycle
 * against a capped throwaway dataset — and there is no browser equivalent, so
 * requiring it of a web upload would gate the dashboard on a command the
 * dashboard cannot run. A browser upload is therefore gated on the admin
 * grant alone; the CLI keeps both gates.
 *
 * Pure so the decision (and its ordering) is unit-testable without a live
 * backend; every real-upload entry point routes through these helpers so the
 * gate can't be added to one endpoint and forgotten on another.

 * exempt the caller from `realDatasetCreateGate`: a fixture that skipped the
 * account gates would stop exercising them, which is the opposite of why it
 * exists. An operator who cannot pass them is not the right operator.

 * All three terms are required, not any: non-production alone would let a dev
