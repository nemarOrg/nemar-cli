/**
 * The runner queue: claim, heartbeat, complete, leases, deadlines and settlement (portable compute, card
 * DM-07; decisions D2, D4 and D6; ADR 0121, decisions 2, 4 and 6; protocol `nemar.runner.v1`).
 *
 * A WAITING runner job is `created` with `runner_claimed_at` NULL (no new state). A registered runner CLAIMS a
 * list of them, keeps each with HEARTBEATS, uploads only under its current LEASE and COMPLETES each, and the
 * job ends in the terminal state the Tapis lifecycle would give it: the same launcher documents, the same
 * `verifyResults`, the same terminal batch (`commitTerminal`), whose `accounting = 'none'` branch writes no
 * ledger entry and stamps the row settled with charge 0. Execution is at least once; ACCEPTANCE IS AT MOST
 * ONCE (a lease is replaced only by a release of an UNSTARTED claim, and a terminal write is a compare on the
 * state the writer read).
 *
 * THE CLAIM IS ONE CONDITIONAL UPDATE per job ({@link CLAIM_RUNNER_JOB_SQL}), the shape of
 * `claimOpenDispatch`: it admits the oldest waiting job of the runner's pool that fits, whose dataset still
 * passes the pipeline eligibility predicate inside the same statement (`PIPELINE_ELIGIBLE_SQL`, joined through
 * the job's stamp: a job with no linked stamp is simply not claimed yet), and only while the runner's
 * registration is unrevoked and its registering owner still stands (`OWNER_STANDING_SQL`). A claim that passed
 * `runnerAccess` before a revoke and commits after it therefore wins nothing. `meta.changes = 1` is the
 * winner test, and each winner has its own lease id.
 *
 * LEASES. A claim's lease lasts `RUNNER_LEASE_SECONDS` on D1's clock; a heartbeat renews it. An unstarted
 * expired lease RELEASES the claim (the count stays counted: at the third the job fails `runner_lost`
 * `claims_exhausted`). A started job whose lease expires is `unreported`, KEEPING its lease id, so a runner
 * that was only partitioned can still land its outputs; an `unreported` job whose outputs completed is
 * verified, one that did not fails `runner_lost` (`runner_revoked` at once when its runner's registration was
 * revoked, which DM-05's revoke batch leaves with the lease cleared and `lease_expires_at` NULL, so the sweep
 * selects by the state and the runner's `revoked_at`; `lease_expired` after `RUNNER_LOST_GIVE_UP_MINUTES`). A
 * started job a grace past its minutes without completed outputs fails `deadline_exceeded`.
 *
 * A CANCEL IS CARRIED BACK ON THE HEARTBEAT. No runner job with a recorded cancel stays live: the sweep ends
 * it when its lease is not current (expired, cleared, or its runner revoked): `cancelled` if its outputs did
 * not complete, verified if they did. A waiting job is ended by `endWaitingRunnerJob` (the lifecycle).
 *
 * EVERY STATEMENT THAT WRITES A LIVE STATE (`running`, `archiving`, `unreported`) TO A RUNNER JOB carries
 * `cancel_requested_at IS NULL`, so a recorded cancel can never be walked back into a live state; a source
 * search test holds this.
 *
 * {@link sweepRunnerLeases} runs on every claim call (so the local stack and staging get it whenever a runner
 * polls) and on the production 30-minute tick; it reads no switch, so turning runners off never strands a
 * claimed job. It is bounded (`RUNNER_SWEEP_BATCH` rows a call, shared by its steps) and logs one line of counts.
 *
 * Logs carry fixed words and counts only: no job id, token, address, specification or name.
