/**
 * The compute gateway's allocation ledger (epic #2005 phase A2, #2007; ADR 0118, decision 3).
 *
 * A hold, a release, a settlement, a refund, a grant, an adjustment and an expiry, over the three
 * tables of migration 0114: `compute_pools` (a holder's running totals), `compute_ledger` (the
 * append-only entries) and the trigger that is the ONE writer of the totals. Amounts are whole
 * thousandths of a service unit (SU), never floating point.
 *
 * THE RULES, each one deliberate:
 *  - Nothing here writes a total. Every function inserts a ledger entry; the migration's AFTER
 *    INSERT trigger takes its deltas into the pool's row (and its held and charged deltas into the
 *    budget pool's), in the same statement. So the totals can never disagree with the ledger and
 *    "only if the entry was written" needs no second statement. A test reads every source file for a
 *    write of a total that is not the trigger's.
 *  - The table refuses what the statements here refuse. Its BEFORE INSERT triggers refuse an entry
 *    whose pool or budget totals would leave 0 to 2^53 - 1, a hold that would take available below 0,
 *    a hold, release, charge, overrun or final settlement on an account or partner pool that names no
 *    `people` budget, any entry whose budget is not the `people` budget of its pool's word, and a
 *    release or charge that does not close the hold it names, under every conflict clause. A refund
 *    and a correction of a charge may name the budget or none: crediting it back is this module's
 *    choice (today it does, the owner's option B) and not the table's. The statements below say
 *    the same as WHERE terms, so that a refusal writes nothing and raises nothing; a caller that
 *    skips them is refused by the table with an error.
 *  - A hold is ONE conditional INSERT (`HOLD_INSERT_SQL`): the pool not frozen, the pool's
 *    available at least the amount, the budget pool's available at least the amount, the key unused
 *    and any guard the caller adds, all in its WHERE. D1 runs a statement whole, so two holds for the
 *    last SU cannot both be written, and a refused hold writes nothing (ADR 0099; the claim of
 *    upstream-repull-dispatch.ts is the precedent). `meta.changes` is the winner test, and the
 *    reasons are read only after a refusal, to say which one. Freezing applies to the holder's own
 *    pool; a frozen budget pool does not refuse a hold.
 *  - A closing entry is one INSERT too, taken from the hold row itself (`RELEASE_INSERT_SQL`,
 *    `SETTLE_INSERT_SQL`): the HELD side and the release are the hold's, so a caller cannot misstate
 *    them, and the hold must be open in the same statement, so a hold closes once. The CHARGED
 *    figure of a settlement is the caller's, capped at the hold; what it used above the hold is an
 *    `overrun` entry written by the same statement.
 *  - The unique indexes are the backstop and the WHERE terms are the ordinary path. A statement that
 *    reached a hold that was already closed, or a step already taken, would be refused by
 *    `compute_ledger_closes_once` or by the unique key, and the caller reads that as closed; the
 *    `NOT EXISTS` terms make the ordinary refusal a statement that writes nothing and raises
 *    nothing, so the two layers answer alike.
 *  - Available is granted minus held minus charged and MAY BE NEGATIVE (an overrun, or an
 *    adjustment of the grant below what is used, is a fact that already happened). It is computed in
 *    Number arithmetic over totals that are checked to be safe integers, so it is exact within
 *    +-(2^53 - 1) and throws beyond; the SQL compares 64-bit integers. A stored total never is
 *    negative or beyond 2^53 - 1.
 *  - Arithmetic is integer. Every amount is checked to be a safe whole number before a statement is
 *    built (`ComputeLedgerError`, `invalid_argument`), so a fraction, NaN or a number a double
 *    cannot hold exactly never reaches SQL; the table refuses what slips past (`typeof`).
 *  - A retry is safe, and a key is never shared. Every entry has a unique key. The Worker's own keys
 *    are made of the job (`job:<id>:hold`, `:final`, `:refund`) or the hold (`hold:<id>:charge`), so
 *    no caller builds a colliding one (a caller's key may not start with `job:` or `hold:`); a grant,
 *    an adjustment and an expiry take the caller's, which an administrator's route scopes to the
 *    actor (`adminKey`). A key that finds its entry returns it only if the request is the same on
 *    EVERY field (kind, pool, budget, amounts, job and reason), and a key reused for anything else is
 *    a conflict.
 *  - A closing step is replayed: the closing entry comes back with `replayed: true` when it is of the
 *    requested kind, and `hold_closed` says which kind closed the hold otherwise. A hold is replayed
 *    only while it is open: the same hold asked for again after it was released or settled is
 *    `hold_closed` too, because a replay would tell the caller a hold is live that its pool no
 *    longer holds.
 *  - Nothing here mails, calls GitHub or Tapis, or is a cron. The job table and the job-count
 *    guards on a hold are phase A3's: `placeHold` takes a caller's own guards and writes nothing.
