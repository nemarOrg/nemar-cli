/**
 * What only GitHub and the version row can say about a re-pull: that its pull request merged, that
 * its version was released, and that a claim to merge was never sent (epic #1046 phase 6, #1912;
 * ADR 0111, decisions 2, 3 and 6).
 *
 * `merged`, `released` and their N.0.1 twins are facts, not steps a caller reports, so the
 * transition route refuses them (`use-verified-route`) and these functions write them after
 * reading the facts themselves, with the Worker's own GitHub credential:
 *  - merged: GitHub says the recorded pull request (its number, its release branch, aimed at
 *    `main`) is merged. The merge commit is GitHub's. A merge for which no NEMAR tool held a claim
 *    (`merged_outside_tool`), and one at a head other than the screened one
 *    (`merged_unscreened_head`), is still recorded, because it happened and a second major would
 *    be a second DOI; each is counted on its own so the record says which. The cap binds NEMAR's
 *    tools only (ADR 0111, Consequences). It is recorded from the open status too, for a pull
 *    request merged before its gates were (both counts then say so).
 *  - released: the version row exists with a DOI, the tag `v<version>` names the commit the
 *    caller reports, and that commit contains the merge. In the same batch, and only when the
 *    edge applies: the version's lineage when the caller verified the tagged tree (N.0.0 only,
 *    decision 4), and the dataset's hed, channel-montage, data and availability stamps are
 *    re-armed (decision 2), so each sweep reads the new version again.
 *  - a claim is released only when the caller says the merge was not sent or was refused, the
 *    claim is at least five minutes old, and GitHub says the pull request is not merged: an
 *    unknown outcome keeps the claim, so a lost answer is resolved from GitHub and never repeated
 *    blind. A caller that does not know what became of the merge (`expired`, how a stuck claim
 *    ends) needs the claim thirty minutes old, long past any merge a tool can have in flight, and
 *    the same answer from GitHub. That is one read and an age, not proof: a merge that lands
 *    between the read and the release is recorded later, by `merged`, as one no tool held a claim
 *    for.
 *
 * A retried `merged` or `released` that finds its fact already recorded, for the same commit,
 * answers with the stored row (`replayed`), so a caller whose answer was lost can ask again; a
 * different commit is refused.
 *
 * Every write here goes through the transition's own checks and compare-and-set
 * (`prepareTransition`, `commitTransition`), and nothing here mails anyone.
