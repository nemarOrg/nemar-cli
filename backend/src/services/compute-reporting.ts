/**
 * What an administrator reads about compute jobs, people and quarters, and the one thing an owner does
 * to an ACCESS report that failed (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118; design section 9).
 *
 * Every view here is FIXED WORDS, NUMBERS AND TIMES. None carries identity: not a name, an email, an
 * ORCID iD, a country or an affiliation, none a specification, a token, an address or a log. A job's
 * account is its number, as `jobView` always showed it. The identity snapshot and a submitted file are
 * reached only through `readRecordObject` (owner-only, reasoned, audited), and the provenance and
 * manifest summaries below are read from the records bucket without them: the launcher's provenance
 * names an image digest, timings and dataset versions, and the manifest summary is a count and a size,
 * never a path.
 *
 *   `listJobRows`                 jobs by flag, state and account, newest first, keyset-paged
 *   `listUnmatchedSacct`          Expanse's rows that no job claims
 *   `resolveJobRef`               a NEMAR job id, a Tapis uuid or a Slurm id, in that order
 *   `recordSummary`               one job: the index row, its ledger entries, provenance, manifest
 *   `accountReport`               one account's jobs and charge in a date range
 *   `accessReport`                distinct gateway users and jobs by partition and source in a quarter
 *   `listAccessReportFailures`    `failed` ACCESS report rows, counted by their fixed word
 *   `listAccessReports`           those rows, listed
 *   `requeueAccessReport`         OWNER-ONLY: put a `failed` row back to `pending`, on the owner's
 *                                 explicit word that ACCESS did NOT record it
