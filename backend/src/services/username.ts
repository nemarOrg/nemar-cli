 * Username format, default, and collision rules (epic #1250, phase #1253).

 * Two populations need a username and have no way to get one today:
 *   - web/ORCID sign-ups, whose `users.username` is NULL by design
 *     (migration 0026) and stays NULL forever -- 19 live rows;
 *   - anyone who wants to request upload access, since the request's admin
 *     review card and `nemar admin approve <username>` are both keyed on it.
 *
 * ADR 0042 fixes the default at FIRST INITIAL + FAMILY NAME (`alovelace`),
 * derived from the same `given_name`/`family_name` pair ADR 0041 made
 * canonical for DOI attribution. That keeps one name in play per account
 * rather than a handle invented at a form and a name read from ORCID.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the rules are testable without a Worker (same
 * reasoning as profile.ts and orcid-auth.ts's decision helpers); the DB reads
 * that feed `taken` live at the call sites.
