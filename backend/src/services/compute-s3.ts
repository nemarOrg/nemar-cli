/**
 * The compute gateway's S3-API signer (epic #2005 phase A3, #2008; ADR 0118, decision 7).
 *
 * Compute storage is two private Cloudflare R2 buckets, reached by the Worker through bindings
 * (`COMPUTE_RECORDS`, `COMPUTE_RESULTS`). A binding has no copy and no presigned address, and hides
 * its bucket's name, so the few things a binding cannot do go through R2's S3 interface: a presigned
 * PUT for one file of one job (the only way a job's bytes reach a bucket, since no storage credential
 * reaches Tapis, a node or the launcher), a presigned GET, and a server-side `CopyObject` (a bundle
 * from `incoming/` into the locked `records/`). They are signed here with aws4fetch against the
 * account endpoint, path style, region `auto`.
 *
 * `generatePresignedPutUrls` and `generatePresignedGetUrl` of `s3.ts` cannot be used: they hardcode
 * the AWS host.
 *
 * THE ENDPOINT. It is `globalThis.NEMAR_COMPUTE_S3_URL` when set, else the Worker secret
 * `COMPUTE_R2_S3_ENDPOINT` (the account endpoint, which is never written in this public repository).
 * `testS3EndpointOverride` is not used, and `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` is never read here: that seam is dead in
 * production, so a test that runs the production flag could not otherwise reach a stand-in. A
 * deployed Worker cannot set a global, so the override cannot be present in one.
 *
 * THE KEY. A key is built from segments the caller names and encoded once, segment by segment, so
 * `a..b.csv`, `100%.txt`, `a+b` and a name with a space or a non-ASCII character all round-trip. It
 * is refused if it could escape (an empty, `.` or `..` segment, a backslash or a control character:
 * the contract's own predicate, `COMPUTE_PATH_RE`, so the Worker and the launcher judge one thing)
 * or if it is longer than the 1,024 bytes a key may be. `assertValidS3Key` is NOT used: it refuses
 * any `..` inside a name and throws on a stray `%`, which would fail an upload for a name the
 * launcher was entitled to use.
 *
 * AN EXPIRY is a whole number of seconds from 1 to 604,800 (seven days, the limit of S3 and of R2),
 * and anything else is refused before anything is signed.
 *
 * THE CHECKSUM. `x-amz-checksum-sha256` can be signed with a PUT's URL: aws4fetch signs any header it
 * is given, and a client that omits it or sends another body is refused. WHETHER R2 ENFORCES IT ON A
 * PRESIGNED PUT HAS NOT BEEN CHECKED AGAINST THE REAL SERVICE (no test here can reach it); until it
 * is, the bound the Worker itself relies on is the object's size, read back through the binding.
