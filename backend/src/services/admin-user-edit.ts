/**
 * What an admin may change on someone else's account, and how a request to do
 * so is read (ADR 0093).
 *
 * Pure functions, so the rules are testable without a Worker; the database
 * reads (does the target exist, does anyone already hold this address) live in
 * the route, which is the only caller.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD: the admin edit reuses the self-service
 * field rules instead of restating them. The name, affiliation, location,
 * username and GitHub handle go through `normalizeProfilePatch`, the function
 * `PATCH /auth/profile` validates with; the email goes through
 * `emailFieldSchema`, the one every auth route validates an address with. (CLI
 * signup has its own schema for the username, which `validateUsernameFormat`
 * mirrors.) An admin therefore cannot store a value the person could not have
 * typed themselves.
 *
 * Two things differ from self-service, on purpose. WHO may change a field is
 * declared in `shared/contract/admin-user.ts`. And there is NO username lock:
 * `PATCH /auth/profile` refuses an approved account's rename with
 * `username_locked` and tells the person to "contact an admin to change it",
 * and this route is that admin.
