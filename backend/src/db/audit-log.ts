// Canonical audit_log insert, shared by every route that writes an audit row.

// and a drifted 3-column `(action, user_id, details)` variant); this module is
// the single shape call sites converge on as they move during the #902 split.
// resource_type / resource_id / details are nullable in the schema (migration
// 0001), so a null-filled 5-column insert is row-identical to the legacy
// 3-column one.
