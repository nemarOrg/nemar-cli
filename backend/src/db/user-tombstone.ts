// Shared SQL for the user tombstone (soft delete), so the DELETE
// /admin/users/by-id/:id endpoint and its behavioral test exercise the EXACT
// same masking statement (no drift between the security logic and its test).
//
// The mask is the load-bearing mechanism for two guarantees:
//   1. PII erasure — email is replaced with a non-PII placeholder; username,
//      github, password, orcid, description, AWS creds, verification tokens and
//      email prefs are nulled; email_verified and orcid_verified are zeroed.
//   2. Re-signup freedom — nulling username/github and rewriting email FREES
//      those UNIQUE values so the original owner can sign up again later. (The
//      signup de-dup checks intentionally still see tombstoned rows.)

/**
 * Masked email for a tombstoned user. Embeds the AUTOINCREMENT primary key,

 * address can never be real or receive mail.
