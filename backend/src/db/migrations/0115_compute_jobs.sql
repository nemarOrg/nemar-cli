-- The compute gateway's job index (epic #2005 phase A3, #2008; ADR 0118, decisions 2, 7 and 9).
--
-- WHAT THIS IS FOR. NEMAR is the record of every tenant job, whichever front door submitted it.
-- The full record (what was submitted, who submitted it, the logs, the results' manifest) lives in
-- the private records bucket; D1 holds one INDEX ROW per job: enough to count, to filter, to settle
-- and to find the record. Two tables carry that:
--   * `compute_jobs`: one row per job, written in the SAME BATCH as the job's hold (see below);
--   * `compute_gateway_users`: the pseudonym an account is reported to ACCESS under, made on the
--     account's first job.
--
-- SEPARATION: D1 JOB ROWS CARRY THE ACCOUNT ID AND FIXED WORDS ONLY. There is no column for a name,
-- an email, a country, an ORCID iD, an affiliation or an OIDC subject, and a test refuses one: those
-- live in `records/<job id>/identity.json` and nowhere else, so deleting an account never has to
-- reach this table and reading this table never reveals a person. `tapis_owner` is the Tapis
-- username a partner job ran under, which is an account name on Tapis and not a NEMAR identity.
--
-- A JOB AND ITS HOLD ARE ONE BATCH (services/compute-jobs.ts): the hold's conditional INSERT, then
-- this table's INSERT gated on that hold row existing, so a refused hold leaves no job row and a job
-- row always has its hold. The column `hold_ledger_id` is that entry's id. Nothing here is a foreign
-- key and none cascades: a job and its ledger entries follow the retention schedule (design section
-- 9, phase A7), never an account's deletion, and the ledger is append-only.
--
-- WORDS. A state, a source, a kind and a pool are enumerated, and a test compares each list with
-- `shared/compute-state.ts` and `shared/contract/compute.ts`. The words a LATER epic may add (a
-- failure code, a cancel reason, a failure detail, a partition) are checked by SHAPE
-- (`NOT GLOB '*[^a-z0-9_]*'`), never by a list, so a new word never forces a rebuild of the table;
-- a test holds every word declared today to the shape. `state = 'failed'` if and only if a failure
-- code is set. Every CHECK term is TRUE or FALSE, never NULL (a CHECK passes on NULL), and every
-- CHECK is named so that a test can say which one refused a row. D1 rejects SQL that bun:sqlite
-- accepts, so every GLOB below is at most 50 characters. A numeric column is checked with
-- `typeof(...) = 'integer'`: SQLite would otherwise keep 1.5 in an INTEGER column.
--
-- compute_jobs, column by column:
--   * `id`: `job_` and 24 lowercase hex digits (COMPUTE_JOB_ID_RE); the prefix of every key of the job.
--   * `account_id`: the NEMAR account the job is attributed to; NULL means no NEMAR account (a
--     partner's job whose owner maps to none, charged to the partner's pool).
--   * `tapis_owner`: the Tapis `owner` of a partner job; NULL for the others.
--   * `gateway_user`: the pseudonym ACCESS is told, copied from compute_gateway_users when the job
--     is made (`gw_` and 20 base32 characters), or `nemar-pipelines` for NEMAR's own jobs; NULL for a
--     job with no account.
--   * `idempotency_key`: the caller's key; the unique index below is per account and only when set.
--   * `source` (cli, web, partner, pipeline), `client_id` (a partner client), `kind` (batch,
--     interactive), `state` (the ten of COMPUTE_STATES, default `created`).
--   * `failure_code`, `failure_detail`, `cancel_reason`: fixed words; `cancel_requested_at`: when.
--   * `tapis_uuid` (unique), `tapis_status`, `slurm_job_id`: what Tapis and Slurm call the job.
--   * `app_id`, `app_version`, `image_digest`: what runs; `spec_digest`: the SHA-256 of the exact
--     bytes of `records/<id>/spec.json`, which is what was ASKED FOR (never the launch specification,
--     which carries a token: the launcher's own digest is a different column, phase A5's).
--   * `partition`, `pool`, `nodes`, `cores_per_node`, `memory_mb`, `gpus`, `minutes`: the resources
--     requested, per node.
--   * `created_at` (on D1's clock), `submitted_at` (NEMAR's submit to Tapis), `remote_submitted_at`,
--     `started_at`, `ended_at` (Tapis's own times), `tapis_synced_at` (the last read back),
--     `records_written_at` (the records have landed; the submit waits for it).
--   * `hold_ledger_id`, `held_milli`, `charged_milli`, `settled_provisional_at`, `settled_final_at`:
--     the ledger's entry, what the job holds and what it has been charged, in whole milli-SU.
--   * `flag_*`: what an administrator is told (COMPUTE_JOB_FLAGS).
--   * `retention_until`, `legal_hold`: the retention sweep honours them (phase A7).
--   * `webhook_nonce`: the secret half of the job's webhook address, a random UUID.
