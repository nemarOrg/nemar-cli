-- The access and refresh tokens of NEMAR's OpenID Connect provider (epic #2014 phase #2018;
-- ADR 0119, decisions 4, 12, 13 and 14).
--
-- WHAT THIS IS FOR. The token endpoint trades a single-use authorization code (migration 0122) for
-- an opaque access token and, when the person granted `offline_access`, a refresh token; a refresh
-- token is traded for a new pair; a confidential client can get an access token for a machine-only
-- scope with the client credentials grant. Every token is OPAQUE: a client learns nothing from it,
-- and NEMAR answers a question about one (userinfo, introspection, a resource route) by looking its
-- row up and reading the account, the grant and the client LIVE. So ending a grant, a client or an
-- account ends its tokens at once, without waiting out a lifetime.
--
-- A TOKEN IS STORED ONLY AS ITS SHA-256. The value (`nmo_at_` or `nmo_rt_` plus 256 random bits) is
-- in the one response that issues it and nowhere else: not here, not in a log.
--
-- `client_id` IS THE `oidc_clients.id` ROW ID, NOT THE PUBLIC `oc_...` STRING, as in 0122.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEYS, as in 0121 and 0122: every reader joins the live rows it needs (`oidc_clients`,
-- `users`, `oidc_grants`), so an orphan confers nothing, and the revocation cascades (#2019) must
-- find these rows rather than have a cascade from `users` delete them. Every CHECK term is TRUE or
-- FALSE, never NULL, because a CHECK passes on NULL.
--
-- oidc_tokens: ONE ROW PER TOKEN ISSUED.
--   id                   the row number; a child names its parent by it.
--   token_hash           the SHA-256 of the token, 64 lowercase hex characters, unique: a token is
--                        looked up by it.
--   kind                 `access` or `refresh`.
--   client_id            the client's ROW id, `oidc_clients.id`.
--   user_id              the account, `users.id`; NULL for a client credentials token, which names
--                        no account.
--   grant_id             the grant the token was issued under, `oidc_grants.id`; NULL exactly when
--                        `user_id` is.
--   code_id              the authorization code the token's family came from, `oidc_codes.id`,
--                        copied to every token of the family, so a second redemption of that code
--                        finds everything it issued; NULL exactly when `user_id` is.
--   family_id            32 lowercase hex characters, the same for every token issued from one
--                        code and its rotations, so a refresh token's reuse (or its revocation)
--                        ends the whole family, access tokens included; NULL exactly when
--                        `user_id` is.
--   parent_id            for a token issued by a refresh, the refresh token that was presented,
--                        `oidc_tokens.id`; NULL for one issued from a code or to a client. How many
--                        refresh children a parent has decides the 30-second retry (ADR 0119 rule 13).
--   audience             the client's `audience` when the token was issued, 1 to 200 characters:
--                        the resource it is bound to, and what introspection matches against a
--                        caller's `introspection_audiences`.
--   scopes               a JSON array of 1 to 20 scope names, sorted, with no repeat (the shape is
--                        checked here, the catalogue is the service's rule). An access token
--                        carries what was asked for (a refresh may narrow it); a refresh token
--                        keeps the scopes of the code its family came from.
--   created_at           UTC `datetime('now')`.
--   expires_at           an access token: 15 minutes after `created_at`. A refresh token: 30 days
--                        after it (idle), and never after `absolute_expires_at`.
--   absolute_expires_at  a refresh token only: 90 days after its FAMILY began, copied unchanged to
--                        every rotation, so no chain of refreshes outlives it. NULL for an access
--                        token.
--   used_at              a refresh token only: when it was rotated (spent). NULL until then, and
--                        always NULL for an access token.
--   revoked_at           NULL while the token is not revoked. Set with `revoked_reason`, together.
--   revoked_reason       a fixed word, never text a caller wrote: `code_replay` (its code was
--                        redeemed again), `refresh_reuse` (a spent or revoked refresh token of its
--                        family was presented), `client_revoked` (its client revoked it, RFC 7009),
--                        and the words the revocation cascades of #2019 add. Lowercase letters,
--                        digits and `_`, at most 40 characters.
--
-- KEPT FOR REUSE DETECTION, THEN PRUNED. A spent refresh token is what a reuse is detected by, so it
-- stays until a day past its family's absolute expiry; an access token stays a day past its own
-- expiry. The token endpoint prunes what is older at the head of every batch that mints.
--
-- D1 limits kept in mind: every GLOB pattern is far under the 50-character limit, no CHECK needs a
-- subquery, and a JSON function in a CHECK is guarded by `json_valid` inside a CASE, because SQLite
-- raises on malformed JSON rather than returning NULL.
