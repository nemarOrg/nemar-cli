-- Every account has an opaque, never-reused OpenID Connect subject (epic #2014 phase #2015;
-- ADR 0119, decision 5).
--
-- A subject is `nmu_` plus 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters (128 random bits). It is what a
-- client of the provider stores as the account's name, so it is fixed before any client exists:
-- it is not the row number, not the email address and not anything a person chose, and it never
-- changes. `nmu_` is a reserved username prefix (`validateUsernameFormat`), so no handle can
-- collide with one.
--
-- WHY THE COLUMN STAYS NULLABLE. SQLite cannot add a NOT NULL column without a default, and a
-- constant default would give every row the same value. The invariant is enforced instead by the
-- two triggers below and checked by the unique index: no row is ever left without a subject, no
-- subject is ever shared, and none is ever changed.
--
-- THE BACKFILL covers EVERY row, tombstones and the internal system account included. A
-- soft-deleted account keeps its row, so it keeps its subject, and a partner that stored one can
-- still be told which account it was (the tombstone mask, `USER_TOMBSTONE_MASK_SQL`, never names
-- the column). `randomblob(16)` is evaluated once per row, so no two rows share a value; the
-- unique index built after it would refuse a repeat and fail the migration loudly rather than
-- ship one (2^-128 per pair).
--
-- ORDER MATTERS. The backfill runs before the triggers exist, so the immutability trigger never
-- sees it, and the unique index is built after the backfill, so it never sees a NULL it would
-- have to treat specially (SQLite allows many NULLs in a unique index in any case).
--
-- D1 limits kept in mind: the GLOB patterns are far under the 50-character limit, and every
-- statement is a plain ALTER, UPDATE, CREATE INDEX or CREATE TRIGGER that D1 runs as written.
--
-- A later migration that REBUILDS `users` (a table rebuild, as 0026 did) must carry the column,
-- the CHECK, the index and both triggers across, or the invariant silently ends there.
