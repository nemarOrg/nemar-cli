-- What a person let a client do, and the one-time codes the authorization endpoint hands out
-- (epic #2014 phase #2017; ADR 0119, decisions 3, 4 and 8).
--
-- WHAT THIS IS FOR. A registered client sends a signed-in person to the authorization endpoint;
-- the person is asked (or, for a first-party client, not asked), and the client gets a single-use
-- code it trades for tokens at the token endpoint (#2018). Two facts are stored: THE GRANT (which
-- scopes this account let this client have, and whether a person said so or the client was
-- first-party) and THE CODE (sixty seconds of permission to collect tokens, bound to everything
-- the token endpoint has to check again).
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEYS, AS IN 0121. `user_id` and the two client and grant references are bare
-- integers. A cascade from `users` would let the deletion of an account silently delete what the
-- revocation cascades (#2019) must find and end; a restricting key would make a hard delete of an
-- account fail on a row it has no reason to know about. Every reader joins the live rows it needs
-- (`users`, `oidc_clients`, `web_sessions`) and so an orphan confers nothing. Every CHECK term is
-- TRUE or FALSE, never NULL, because a CHECK passes on NULL.
--
-- oidc_grants: AT MOST ONE LIVE ROW PER ACCOUNT AND CLIENT (the partial unique index below).
--   id            the row number; a code names its grant by it.
--   user_id       the account, `users.id`.
--   client_id     the client's ROW, `oidc_clients.id`, not its public `client_id` string.
--   scopes        a JSON array of 1 to 20 scope names, sorted, with no repeat. The table checks
--                 the shape and the characters (as 0121 does for `allowed_scopes`); that each is a
--                 scope of the catalogue is the service's rule.
--   consent_kind  `user` when the person allowed the scopes on the consent screen, `first_party`
--                 when the client was first-party and nobody was asked. Only a `user` grant counts
--                 as consent: a client that stops being first-party is asked again, whatever a
--                 `first_party` grant holds.
--   created_at    UTC `datetime('now')`, when the account first granted this client anything.
--   revoked_at    NULL while the grant is live. Set by the revocation phase (#2019); a revoked
--                 row stays for the record and a new grant is a new row.
--
-- oidc_codes: ONE ROW PER AUTHORIZATION CODE, KEYED BY ITS HASH.
--   code_hash       the SHA-256 of the code, 64 lowercase hex characters. The code itself (256
--                   random bits) is in the redirect to the client and stored nowhere.
--   client_id       the client's row, `oidc_clients.id`.
--   user_id         the account, `users.id`.
--   grant_id        the grant the code was minted under, `oidc_grants.id`.
--   redirect_uri    the exact redirect address the code was sent to, which the token request must
--                   repeat (RFC 6749 section 4.1.3).
--   scopes          the scopes the code carries: what was asked for, never more than the grant.
--   nonce           the request's `nonce`, copied into the identity token, or NULL.
--   code_challenge  the PKCE S256 challenge, 43 base64url characters (S256 is the only method,
--                   ADR 0119 rule 1, so the method is not stored).
--   auth_time       when the person signed in: the session's own `created_at`.
--   created_at      UTC `datetime('now')`.
--   expires_at      sixty seconds after `created_at`, written by D1's clock, and never later (the
--                   CHECK below).
--   used_at         NULL until the token endpoint redeems the code (#2018). A used row is kept
--                   until an hour past its expiry, so a second redemption is recognized as a replay
--                   and not mistaken for an unknown code; the check route prunes what is older.
--
-- D1 limits kept in mind: every GLOB pattern is far under the 50-character limit, no CHECK needs a
-- subquery, and a JSON function in a CHECK is guarded by `json_valid` inside a CASE, because SQLite
-- raises on malformed JSON rather than returning NULL.
