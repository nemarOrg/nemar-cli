-- The dataset pull-request review (ADR 0092).
--
-- When a pull request is opened or updated against `main` of a dataset repository, the Worker
-- (which the NEMAR GitHub App delivers pull_request events to once it is subscribed to them, forks
-- included) decides whether to review it, records the attempt here, and dispatches a workflow to
-- nemarDatasets/.github. That workflow first CLAIMS the review (the Worker accepts the one-shot
-- token and the row records the time), then reads the change as git data, asks a model three
-- questions (is anything lost or broken, does the revision advance, is the dataset materially
-- better) and posts a report back to /webhooks/pr-review-result. The Worker stores what
-- `parsePrReviewReport` accepted and publishes the result as a check-run and one pull-request
-- comment. The report's shape, and every word in it, is declared in `shared/pr-review.ts`.
--
-- One row per (dataset, pull request, head commit): a delivery GitHub repeats, or a second event
-- for the same commit, finds the row and does not review again, which is also what stops a
-- duplicate delivery from costing a second review.
--
--   * `state`: dispatched (handed to GitHub, waiting for a report), reported (a verdict is
--     stored), declined (not sent to the model: the contributor is paused, or a rate limit
--     applied), errored (no verdict: the run reported that it could not decide, the dispatch
--     failed, the commit was superseded before it started, or the report it posted was refused),
--     unreported (the watchdog gave up waiting). The same list as `REVIEW_STATES`; a test keeps
--     them equal. A reader still must not trust the column.
--   * `verdict`: pass, fail or uncertain, DERIVED by `verdictOf` from the report and the git facts
--     and stored beside it so the tally is a query. Set exactly when `state` is 'reported'.
--   * `detail`: the closed word for a declined or errored row (`DECLINE_REASONS`, `RUN_ERRORS`).
--     Set exactly when `state` is 'declined' or 'errored', and a declined row holds a decline word
--     and an errored row a run-error word, so no row can publish the wrong sentence.
--   * `nonce`: signed into the callback token, the one-shot handshake the other callbacks use.
--     Cleared when a result is stored. KEPT when the watchdog marks a row 'unreported', so a late
--     but valid report is still accepted and then replaces the "could not decide" check.
--   * `claimed_at`: when the workflow claimed the review, before it spent anything on the model.
--     A dispatch nobody can claim (it carries no valid token) buys nothing.
--   * `author_id` / `author_login`: who opened the pull request. The numeric GitHub id is the key
--     (a login can be renamed or reused); the login is only for people to read. A fork's author is
--     whoever opened the pull request, not the fork's owner.
--   * `author_association`: GitHub's own relationship label, used only to choose a rate cap.
--   * `from_fork`: 1 when the head lives in another repository. The review is identical either
--     way, because the workflow reads `refs/pull/N/head` from the BASE repository and never runs
--     anything from the pull request.
--   * `report`: the parsed report, re-serialized JSON, never the raw callback body. Set exactly
--     when `state` is 'reported'.
--   * `check_run_id`: THIS commit's check-run, created as "in progress" and then updated to its
--     conclusion. `comment_id`: the pull request's one comment, created by the first review that
--     could publish it and reused by the reviews of later commits.
--   * `created_at`: when the commit was first seen; the rate windows count from it. `seen_at`:
--     when it was last delivered. "Latest commit" means the last one SEEN, so force-pushing back
--     to an earlier reviewed commit makes that commit's result the pull request's current one.
--   * `published_at` / `publish_attempts`: whether this row's final outcome reached GitHub as a
--     check-run. NULL means not yet: the watchdog republishes such rows, a few times, so a GitHub
--     outage cannot leave a check "in progress" for good.
--
-- The contributor tally is not stored. "Rejected" and "decided" are counted from this table by
-- `AUTHOR_TALLY_SQL` in services/pr-review.ts (ADR 0034: derive, don't store), so a re-run or a
-- later commit that passes corrects the tally by itself.
--
-- No FOREIGN KEY to `datasets` or `users`: deleting a dataset must not be blocked by, or cascade
-- into, its review history, and a contributor is a GitHub account that need not have a NEMAR one.
