-- The back-channel logout deliveries of NEMAR's OpenID Connect provider (epic #2014 phase #2019;
-- ADR 0119, decisions 12 and 15).
--
-- WHAT THIS IS FOR. When a path ends an account's grants (revocation, deletion, a merge, an ORCID
-- change, a compute suspension), each client that registered a back-channel logout address has to be
-- TOLD, or its own session for the person lives on after NEMAR stopped honouring it. The telling is a
-- request to a partner's server, and a request to somebody else's server never belongs inside the
-- database batch that ends the grants: the batch must commit whatever the partner does. So the batch
-- writes only the INTENT, one row here per client, and a sender does the call afterwards (the first
-- attempt right after the commit, the retries from a tick). A row is the record that a client was owed
-- a logout and what became of it; it is never the reason a revocation did or did not happen.
--
-- `client_id` IS THE `oidc_clients.id` ROW ID, NOT THE PUBLIC `oc_...` STRING, as in 0122 and 0123.
-- The sender joins the client it needs, which is also how it sees a client that was disabled since.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEYS, as in 0121 to 0123. A row outlives the client and the account it names; the sender
-- reads the client live and records `client_disabled` for one that is no longer active, and `sub` is
-- the account's opaque `users.oidc_subject`, which the tombstone keeps, so a deleted account is still
-- named by the same value its partner knew it by. Every CHECK term is TRUE or FALSE, never NULL,
-- because a CHECK passes on NULL.
--
-- oidc_logout_deliveries: ONE ROW PER CLIENT TOLD ABOUT ONE ENDING.
--   id                 the row number.
--   client_id          the client's ROW id, `oidc_clients.id`: an integer, NOT the public string.
--   sub                the account's `users.oidc_subject` when the row was queued: `nmu_` plus 32
--                      lowercase hexadecimal characters. It is the logout token's `sub`.
--   reason             why the grants ended: a fixed word, `OIDC_END_REASONS` in `shared/oidc.ts`
--                      (the list below is that list, and a test holds the two together). It is NOT
--                      sent to the partner: a logout token carries no reason.
--   status             `pending` (to be attempted, or retried), `sent` (the partner answered 200 or
--                      204), `failed` (refused by the partner with a 4xx, or every attempt used),
--                      `fenced` (outside production, an address that is neither loopback nor listed:
--                      recorded and never sent). A row that is not `pending` is never attempted again.
--   attempts           how many attempts were claimed, 0 to 6: the first and at most five retries.
--   next_attempt_at    UTC `datetime('now')` form. Set exactly while the row is `pending` (CHECK): the
--                      earliest time of its next attempt, and, while an attempt is in flight, the end
--                      of that attempt's claim. NULL once the row is terminal.
--   last_status        the HTTP status of the last attempt that got an answer, else NULL.
--   last_error_class   a fixed word for what went wrong on the last attempt (`timeout`, `network`,
--                      `redirect`, `http_4xx`, `http_5xx`, ...: `OIDC_LOGOUT_ERROR_CLASSES`), NEVER
--                      the text of an error or of the partner's answer. Lowercase letters, digits and
--                      `_`, at most 40 characters; the words are the service's rule.
--   jti                the `jti` of the logout token the LAST attempt sent: 32 lowercase hexadecimal
--                      characters, unique, so a partner's complaint can be matched to a row. A token
--                      is made per attempt, so a retry is a new token and not a replay of the old.
--   created_at         UTC `datetime('now')`: when the ending was committed.
--   sent_at            set exactly when `status` is `sent` (CHECK).
--
-- D1 limits kept in mind: every GLOB pattern is far under the 50-character limit, no CHECK needs a
-- subquery, and nothing here compounds more than a few terms.
