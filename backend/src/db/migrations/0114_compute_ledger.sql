-- The compute gateway's allocation ledger and owner policy (epic #2005 phase A2, #2007; ADR 0118,
-- decision 3).
--
-- WHAT THIS IS FOR. NEMAR says how many Expanse service units (SU) a holder may spend and refuses a
-- spend that would exceed it, atomically. Three tables carry that:
--   * `compute_policy`: the owner's policy, one immutable row per version (the current policy is
--     the highest version, and no row means DEFAULT_COMPUTE_POLICY of shared/contract/compute.ts);
--   * `compute_pools`: one row per holder and pool (cpu, gpu) with three running totals;
--   * `compute_ledger`: the append-only entries, whose deltas the totals are the sum of.
--
-- AMOUNTS ARE WHOLE THOUSANDTHS OF AN SU (milli-SU), never floating point. Every amount column
-- refuses a value that is not an INTEGER (`typeof`) and one beyond 2^53 - 1 (9007199254740991), the
-- largest number a JavaScript double holds exactly, so a total read back in the Worker is exact. A
-- sum of two such values stays far below the 2^63 at which SQLite would turn an integer into a
-- float, so no statement here can.
--
-- THE LEDGER IS THE ONLY WRITER OF A POOL'S TOTALS. `compute_ledger_apply` (AFTER INSERT) adds an
-- entry's three deltas to `pool_id`'s row and its held and charged deltas to `budget_pool_id`'s row.
-- So a total can never disagree with the ledger, "only if the entry was inserted" holds by
-- construction (there is no second statement to forget). No code path updates `granted_milli`,
-- `held_milli` or `charged_milli`; a test reads every source file and every migration for one.
--
-- THE TABLE REFUSES WHAT THE STATEMENT REFUSES, BEFORE THE ENTRY EXISTS. A pool's CHECKs would
-- refuse a total out of range when the trigger above updates it, but a conflict clause on the OUTER
-- statement (`INSERT OR IGNORE`, `OR FAIL`, `OR REPLACE`) overrides the one that applies inside a
-- trigger, so the entry would stay and the totals would not move. The BEFORE INSERT triggers below
-- raise ABORT, which no conflict clause overrides, so the entry is refused whole under every one:
--   * `compute_ledger_totals_in_range`: no total of the pool, or of the budget it names, may leave
--     0 to 2^53 - 1 (so a refund of more than was charged, an expiry of more than was granted and a
--     total past the largest exact one are refused);
--   * `compute_ledger_hold_fits`: a hold may not take the pool's or the budget's available below 0;
--   * `compute_ledger_closes_its_hold`: a release or a charge names a hold of the same job, pool,
--     budget and held amount.
-- A hold is therefore an entry the table itself would refuse unless it fits, and the statement of
-- services/compute-ledger.ts (`HOLD_INSERT_SQL`) is the same rule, written as a WHERE so that a
-- refused hold writes nothing and raises nothing (ADR 0099; the claim of upstream-repull-dispatch.ts
-- is the precedent). A job has one hold. A hold is closed once, by a release or a charge, and the
-- unique index on `hold_ref` is what says so.
--
-- THE BUDGET RULE IS THE TABLE'S, NOT THE CALLER'S. An entry on an account or a partner pool that
-- moves a budget (a hold, release, charge, refund, overrun, and an adjustment of a charge or a job's
-- final settlement) MUST name the platform `people` pool of the same cpu or gpu word, and an entry
-- on a platform pool names NO budget. `compute_ledger_budget_is_people` and
-- `compute_ledger_budget_required` enforce exactly that, and nothing else: they do not say which
-- budget a caller's correction should credit (that is a policy question of the owner's).
--
-- WHAT THE DATABASE CANNOT PREVENT, which only a reader and the source scan guard:
--   * `INSERT OR REPLACE` and `REPLACE INTO` rewrite a conflicting row without firing the
--     append-only DELETE trigger (recursive triggers, which would fire it, cannot be enabled on
--     D1). Nothing in the source may use either on these tables; a test scans for them.
--   * `DROP TABLE` removes the append-only triggers with the table. A rebuild of `compute_ledger`
--     must COPY THE ROWS BEFORE it creates `compute_ledger_apply`, or the copy fires the trigger and
--     every total doubles; recreate every trigger and index named here afterwards.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEY, to `users` or between these tables, and none that cascades: ledger entries are
-- never removed by a cascade from the account row (design section 5), so an account's deletion
-- leaves its pools and entries as they are. The ledger and the policy are append-only; their
-- retention, and the anonymisation of `holder_ref` and `actor_user_id`, are the job of phase A7
-- (#2012), which adds its own narrowly scoped exception in its own migration. The triggers that
-- stand where a foreign key would (the pool exists; the budget is the platform people pool of the
-- same word) are named below. Every CHECK term is TRUE or FALSE, never NULL: a CHECK passes on
-- NULL, so a term that could be NULL would let the row in. Every CHECK is named, so a test can say
-- which one refused a row.
--
-- SQLite runs BEFORE triggers ahead of the CHECKs, so an entry for a pool that does not exist is
-- refused by the trigger's message and not by a CHECK: that is why `pool_id` has no CHECK of its
-- own, and why a trigger's words, not a CHECK's, are what a refusal of a budget, a total or a
-- closing hold carries. D1 rejects SQL that bun:sqlite accepts, so every GLOB below is at most 50
-- characters.

--   * `version`: 1, 2, 3 ... in the order they were set; the highest is the current policy.
--   * `policy_json`: the whole policy, a JSON object of at most 64 KiB, validated by the strict
--     ComputePolicySchema before it is written (services/compute-policy.ts). The CASE is load-bearing:
--     json_type() throws on malformed JSON and SQLite does not promise left-to-right evaluation of
--     AND, so the CASE guarantees json_valid runs first (migration 0074 says the same).
--   * `set_by`: the owner's user id. No foreign key; the writer checks the account is an owner in
--     the same statement that inserts the row.
--   * `note`: why, in at most 500 characters; optional.
--   * `created_at`: when, on D1's clock.

--     charge held <= 0, charged >= 0        a hold settled: the hold leaves `held`, what the job
--                                           used (never more than the hold) enters `charged`

--     expire granted-                       unused SU that lapse (a renewal)
--   * `pool_id`: the pool the entry is about; the trigger takes the three deltas into its row. No
--     CHECK here: `compute_ledger_pool_exists` refuses a pool that does not exist, and runs first.
--   * `budget_pool_id`: the platform people pool of the same word a spend on an account or partner
--     pool is also counted against; NULL on a platform pool's own entries. Only a kind that spends
--     may name one (a grant and an expiry may not, nor may an adjustment of the grant). The
--     trigger takes the held and charged deltas into its row, never granted.
--   * `granted_delta_milli`, `held_delta_milli`, `charged_delta_milli`: the change to each total,
--     whole milli-SU within +- (2^53 - 1), 0 when the kind does not move it.
--   * `job_id`: the job (`job_` and 24 lowercase hex digits, COMPUTE_JOB_ID_RE) a hold, release,
--     charge, refund or overrun is about, and the job whose final settlement an adjustment is
--     (that adjustment carries one); NULL for a grant, an expiry and an admin's adjustment. A job
--     has one hold (`compute_ledger_one_hold_per_job`). A job's charge is the sum of
--     `charged_delta_milli` by `job_id` over its charge, overrun, refund and final-settlement
--     adjustment entries.
--   * `hold_ref`: the id of the hold a release or a charge closes (required for both, and checked
--     by `compute_ledger_closes_its_hold`) and an overrun belongs to; NULL otherwise. A hold is
--     closed once (`compute_ledger_closes_once`).
--   * `reason`: a fixed word, 1 to 64 characters of lowercase letters, digits and `_`
--     (COMPUTE_WORD_RE, and a test compares the two), never free text.
--   * `actor_user_id`: the person who did it, or NULL for the Worker's own entries.
--   * `idempotency_key`: unique over the whole ledger, 1 to 128 characters of letters, digits and
--     `. _ : -`. A retry with the key of an entry that was written finds that entry.
--   * `created_at`: when, on D1's clock.
