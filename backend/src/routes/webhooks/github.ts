// filter it down to enrichment-relevant pushes, and dispatch the central
// `run-enrichment` workflow on `nemarDatasets/.github`.
//
// Phase 1 of epic #601 / sub-issue #602. Until the strip script runs, the
// per-repo `llm-enrichment.yml` will continue to fire on the same push; both
// pipelines hit `/webhooks/llm-enrich`, where the `source_hash` guard makes
// the duplicate a Stage-2 no-op.

 *  output, written by `nemar-publish-bot` on every successful run. Listing
 *  it here turned every enrichment commit into a fresh trigger and Haiku's
 *  non-deterministic prose ensured the file always looked "changed" to the
 *  push filter, so the pipeline self-fired forever (#643, observed on
 *  on007827: ~60 runs/hr at ~$0.01 each on the then-current OpenRouter/Haiku
 *  backend — the pipeline now runs claude-sonnet-5 on Claude Platform on AWS
 *  at a higher per-run cost, so the guard matters even more).
 *  Manual recovery / re-enrichment is still available via
