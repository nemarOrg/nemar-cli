/**
 * OpenID Connect discovery and the signing keys' public set (epic #2014 phase #2016; ADR 0119,
 * decision 2):
 *
 *   GET /.well-known/openid-configuration    the discovery document
 *   GET /oauth/jwks                          the public keys, as a JSON Web Key Set
 *
 * Both live on the API host PERMANENTLY, because that is the issuer, and a client that cannot
 * fetch them cannot validate a token. So both are exempt from the maintenance mode
 * (`middleware/maintenance.ts`) and from the rate limiter (`middleware/rateLimit.ts`), by the one
 * list of paths in `shared/oidc.ts`; what that costs (a key-set read per request) is bounded by the
 * short per-database cache in `services/oidc-keys.ts`.
 *
 * Both answer 404, as the API's own unrouted 404, unless the request is on the OIDC surface
 * ({@link oidcSurface}): the provider is enabled (`OIDC_SECRET`), the request names the issuer's
 * host, and the path has no `/nemar` prefix. The Worker mounts the API at both `/` and `/nemar`,
 * and forks the data, zarr and MCP hosts before the API app is reached; a document served on any of
 * those would name an issuer the host is not.
 *
 * {@link oidcSurface} is the middleware every `/oauth` route and every owner route reuses, so the
 * rule is one function and a route cannot forget it.
