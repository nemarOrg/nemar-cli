/**
 * The OpenID Connect authorization endpoint's two routes (epic #2014 phase #2017; ADR 0119), mounted
 * under the same `/auth` prefix as the other auth families:
 *
 *   POST /auth/oidc/authorize   check: what should happen to this authorization request
 *   POST /auth/oidc/consent     decide: the person's answer on the consent screen
 *
 * Both are reached only by the website's page at `app.nemar.org/oauth/authorize`, server-side,
 * forwarding the person's `Cookie` header with an `Origin` pinned to its own. Every decision is in
 * `services/oidc-authorize.ts`; the shapes are `shared/contract/oidc-authorize.ts`.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE GUARDS, which a route cannot reorder (`test/oidc-authorize-inventory.test.ts`
 * walks the router's table):
 *
 *   1. {@link oidcAuthorizeSurface}: 404, as an unrouted path does, unless the provider is on
 *      (`OIDC_SECRET`), the request is on the issuer's host with no `/nemar` prefix
 *      (`onOidcSurface`), and sessions are issued under the `__Host-` cookie name
 *      (`HOST_PREFIXED_SESSION_COOKIE`). Only a `__Host-` session may approve a grant (ADR 0119
 *      rule 10); with the flag off none exists, and a person sent to sign in would come back to the
 *      same answer for ever.
 *   2. {@link originGuard}: 403 for a missing or foreign `Origin`, before the session is read, as
 *      every other cookie-authenticated write here does. A partner host is foreign (ADR 0119 rule 9).
 *   3. `webSessionMiddleware`, then the handler: a session read under the LEGACY cookie name is no
 *      session at all here, because a sibling host can set that cookie for the parent domain; then
 *      the per-account budget (thirty a minute, both routes together); then the body.
 *
 * Every answer is `no-store`: it carries a code, a consent token, or a refusal about one.
