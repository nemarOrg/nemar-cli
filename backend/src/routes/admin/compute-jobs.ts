/**
 * The compute gateway's job commands for an administrator (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118):
 *
 *   POST /admin/compute/jobs/:id/cancel    cancel a job (at Tapis, and release its hold if it never started)
 *   POST /admin/compute/jobs/:id/advance   one step: submit a `created` job, or read the job back from
 *                                          Tapis and apply it, and repair what a finished job is owed; a
 *                                          runner job is refused `invalid_body` naming `executor`
 *
 * `advance` is the way a job advances in development, where no compute cron runs. Both are the same
 * code the webhook, the 30-minute tick and a person's own cancel run (`advanceComputeJob`,
 * `requestComputeCancel`): an administrator has no second path to a job's state.
 *
 * What an administrator is shown is `jobView`: fixed words, numbers and times, `platform_failure` (an
 * INFORMATION flag, so a NEMAR-caused failure can be compensated by a manual grant: nothing is ever
 * refunded automatically) and the four flags. No identity, no specification, no token, no address and
 * no log. Every refusal is `{ error, code }` with the words of `shared/compute-state.ts`. The routes
 * sit behind the admin router's middleware (authentication, the admin role, the cookie-origin guard).
