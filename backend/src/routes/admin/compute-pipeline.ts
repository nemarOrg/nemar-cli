/**
 * An administrator's commands on NEMAR's own pipelines (epic #2005 phase A6, #2011; ADR 0118):
 *
 *   POST /admin/compute/pipeline/run      run a recipe over one dataset version, or over the next datasets
 *                                         it has not been run over; `dry_run` says what it would do
 *   GET  /admin/compute/pipeline/status   the stamps, filtered, newest first, after they were synced
 *
 * A run over the eligible datasets is bounded, for every actor, by its `limit`, the per-invocation bound
 * (`COMPUTE_PIPELINE_RUN_PER_INVOCATION`), what is left of `pipelines.dailyJobCap` and what is left of the
 * live cap of the recipe's pool (`dispatchEligible`); the answer's `room` says what was left and which of
 * them bounded the run. One named dataset is bounded by the live cap (the hold refuses it as
 * `over_concurrency`) and only counted by the daily cap (issue #2121). A dry run reports the same room and
 * trims what it would dispatch to it.
 *
 * The request names a recipe, then ONE dataset (with an optional version) or `eligible` with a `limit`,
 * `dry_run`, and optionally the `executor` (`tapis`, the default, or `runner`, ADR 0121). A recipe lists the
 * executors it may be dispatched to and one it does not list is `invalid_body` naming `executor`; so is a
 * runner run over `eligible`; a live runner run is refused `runners_disabled` unless the runners switch is on.
 * A runner run makes a job with no hold that waits for a runner and is never submitted. It names nothing else: the dataset row (and with it eligibility, ADR 0065), the version
 * row, the service account, the pool and the runtime image are the Worker's own. A request with any other
 * key is refused, so a field a caller believes it can set is never silently dropped.
 *
 * A dry run reads only and works in every environment; it writes nothing, not even an audit row. A live
 * run refuses `compute_disabled` unless compute is on, and is audited as `compute.pipeline.run` with
 * counts and fixed words (never a path, a name or a value). The stamps are synced before every run and
 * every status read. Every refusal is `{ error: <sentence>, code: <word> }`; an invalid body names the
 * fields and never echoes a value. The routes sit behind the admin router's middleware (authentication,
 * the admin role, the cookie-origin guard). Nothing here touches GitHub or sends mail.
