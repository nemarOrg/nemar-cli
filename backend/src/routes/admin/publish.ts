 * the validation steps is told what matters). Read on the first look at the request and again
 * after a lost write, so both answer by the same rule.
 *
 * The first refusal ignores the status and the block reason on purpose, and so differs from the
 * approval's gate (`publishingStanding`, which will not trust the steps of a `requested` row or of
 * a `blocked` one with another reason, so that new content cannot skip the gates). The gate asks
 * whether to trust old steps; a denial asks whether anything irreversible has happened. A run that
 * made the S3 objects public-read and the repository public, and was then walked back for the
 * owner's name, keeps those steps when the owner requests again (the row goes to `requested`, or
 * to a block of the screen's or the minimum's, with `steps_completed` kept; follow-up #1766
 * tracks that), and the data is still public. A request's completed steps are that request's own
 * acts, so one that has started publishing is never denied, whatever its status.
 *
 * The rule reads two columns, because a step is recorded as done only after it has run. The run
 * sets `current_step` before each step and keeps it when the step fails or is cut off, so a run
 * interrupted inside `s3_public_read` (the first step that changes anything: its bucket-policy
 * write may have landed without being acknowledged) has only validation steps in `steps_completed`
 * and `s3_public_read` in `current_step`. A step outside the validation-only ones in either column
 * means the data may be public (ADR 0103, decision 11).

   *
   * The body carries `resume`, `skip_ci_check` and the S3 lock fields as before, and two fields
   * of an approval that is gated: `acknowledge_identifier_screen` (the identifier screen's
   * reason, ADR 0086) and `override_publication_review` (the review shown and the reasons shown,

   *
   * The body may name the request the run is for, `request_id` (#1579; ADR 0103, decision 7).
   *
   * The header `X-Approval-Dispatch-Token` is the proof that a call belongs to a web click's claim
   * (#1604; ADR 0103, decisions 3 to 6). A call that carries the token of the request's current
   * claim, while that claim's lease is live, is recorded as the administrator who clicked (the
   * caller is kept as `executed_by`); a call with no token (or a blank one) is its caller's own
   * act whatever the lease says, and once it passes every gate its mark takes the claim over, so
   * the executor the click dispatched is refused at its next call. A token that is stale or has
   * lapsed is refused and changes nothing, never downgraded to the caller. A call that carries a
   * valid token may not carry a decision (an override, an acknowledgment or `skip_ci_check: true`;
   * an explicit `false` is no decision): the click recorded the override and the acknowledgment.
   *
   * Refusals, each with a stable code in `error` and a sentence in `message`:
   *   403 origin_not_allowed  an override sent with a session cookie: it is accepted only with
   *                         an API key, and the website records one through approve-dispatch
   *                         (ADR 0102, section 8; ADR 0103, decision 10 keeps this stricter rule).
   *                         (A cookie request with no NEMAR origin never gets this far: the
   *                         router's `cookieOriginGuard` answers it with the same code.)
   *   409 request_mismatch  `request_id` is not the newest active request: it was denied or filed
   *                         again since the caller read it. Answered right after the 404 for no
   *                         request and before everything below, so nothing is recorded.
   *   409 request_blocked   the request is `blocked` and is not a run that started publishing
   *                         (the owner-name walk-back); whatever the flag says
   *   409 identifier_screen_not_clear  the identifier screen does not allow it (ADR 0086)
   *   409 publication_review_not_clear  the review does not allow it, with a `refusal` word and
   *                         the review's words (ADR 0102)
   *   409 dispatch_superseded  the token is not the request's current claim: it was replaced by
   *                         a newer click, released, taken over by an approval at a terminal, or
   *                         is not a token (also: the claim was replaced between the check and
   *                         the mark). Nothing was changed.
   *   409 dispatch_expired  the token is genuine, but its run sat idle past the 15 minute lease
   *   409 decision_with_dispatch_token  a call that carries a valid token sent an override, an
   *                         acknowledgment or a skipped CI check: nothing was recorded under
   *                         anybody
   *   409 request_changed   the request was denied or blocked while the approval was checked:
   *                         nothing ran, and the request is read again
   *   409 approval_closed_during_run  the request was closed (denied, blocked again or filed
   *                         again) while the run ran, or when a resumed run whose steps are all
   *                         done found a request that is not `approving`: the steps HAVE run, the

  /**
   * POST /admin/publish/:id/approve-dispatch - Launch an approval from the web
   * (ADR 0080).
   *
   * Approval is not one request: after the irreversible DOI publish, S3 Object
   * Lock runs in batches the CALLER must keep requesting, so a click cannot run
   * it inside one Worker invocation and the loop is deliberately not moved into
   * the Worker. This route claims the request, records WHO clicked, and hands
   * the run to an executor (a GitHub Actions workflow that drives the CLI)
   * through `repository_dispatch`, then answers 202 straight away. Closing the
   * page cannot matter: the state lives in `publication_requests`.
   *
   * The executor calls `POST /publish/:id/approve` with its own service key and the claim's
   * dispatch token (#1604; ADR 0103, decisions 1 to 3): the token, a MAC over this claim's
   * dataset, request, clicker and instant (`approval_dispatched_at`, as stored), is minted here
   * and handed to the executor in the dispatch payload. The orchestrator records the admin who
   * clicked, rather than the bot, for a call that presents it while the lease is live. `/approve`
   * is the contract for every executor, a terminal included: it also takes the review's override
   * in its body, and answers 403 origin_not_allowed for an override sent with a cookie, and the
   * 409s `request_blocked`, `request_changed`, `approval_closed_during_run`,
   * `dispatch_superseded`, `dispatch_expired`, `decision_with_dispatch_token` and
   * `publication_review_not_clear`, besides the identifier screen's own (see its docblock). The
   * executor sends no override: its run rides on the clicker's, recorded here before the
   * dispatch. The token is never logged, audited, listed or answered.
   *
   * A cookie request must come from a NEMAR origin and a bearer key is not asked: the admin
   * router's `cookieOriginGuard` decides that for every write, before this handler runs.
   *
   * Errors carry a stable code in `error` and a sentence in `message`:
   *   403 origin_not_allowed  a cookie request from a non-NEMAR origin (the router's guard)
   *   404 not_found         no active request for the dataset, or it stopped
   *                         being one (published or denied) before the claim
   *   409 not_dispatchable  the newest active request is `blocked`
   *   409 already_in_flight a run is live (services/approval-dispatch.ts), a

   *                         allow approval (epic #1610 phase 4): not run, not

   *                         a `refusal` word and the review's words, and an override that
   *                         is recorded is recorded after the head check (below)
   *   400 invalid_dataset_id  the id is not one the executor's workflow accepts for this
