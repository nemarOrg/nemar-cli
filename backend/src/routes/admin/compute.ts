/**
 * The compute gateway's owner and admin routes: the policy and the allocation pools (epic #2005
 * phase A2, #2007; ADR 0118). The wire words and the shapes the CLI parses are in
 * shared/contract/compute-admin.ts.
 *
 *   GET  /compute/policy                              owner     the policy in force
 *   PUT  /compute/policy                              owner     the next version (audited)
 *   GET  /compute/pools                               admin     a page of pools
 *   GET  /compute/pools/by-id/:accountId              admin     one account's pools
 *   POST /compute/pools/by-id/:accountId/grant        admin     SU into an account's pool
 *   POST /compute/pools/by-id/:accountId/adjust       admin     a correction of its grant (a charge: owner)
 *   POST /compute/pools/platform/:key/grant           owner     SU into a platform budget
 *   POST /compute/pools/platform/:key/adjust          owner     a correction of a platform budget
 *   GET  /compute/status                              admin     the switches, Tapis, storage (phase A4)
 *
 * Admin-only through the router's middleware; the owner-only routes check the role here, before the
 * body is read, and say so (403, `owner_only`). A grant and an adjustment need an `Idempotency-Key`
 * header, which the ledger stores behind the kind and the actor (`adminKey`), so a repeat of one
 * grants once and a second administrator's same key is their own request. Every refusal is
 * `{ error: <sentence>, code: <word> }`; an invalid body names the fields and never echoes a value.
 * Every write is audited in the same batch as its ledger entry (`compute.policy.set`,
 * `compute.pool.grant`, `compute.pool.adjust`). One request moves at most 2^40 milli-SU
 * (`COMPUTE_REQUEST_MILLI_MAX`), and a total that would pass 2^53 - 1 is a 409 `would_exceed_limit`.
 *
 * INTERIM OWNER RULES, easy to loosen: a correction of an account's CHARGE is the owner's (an
 * administrator may correct a grant). THE `people` BUDGET RECORDS CONSUMPTION ONLY (the owner's
 * decision of 2026-11-04, option A): an adjustment that RAISES the charge of an account's pool
 * raises the `people` budget of the same word with it, and one that LOWERS it moves the person's
 * pool alone and leaves the budget's consumption as it was, so nothing an administrator does to a
 * person's pool gives budget back (the only entries that lower the budget are a job's final
 * settlement and the owner's own correction of the platform budget, which is that pool's own entry
 * and names no budget; the table would take either, and the ledger service refuses a lowering
 * correction that names the budget). A platform pool is its own budget, and a correction of a grant
 * names none. A grant to a deleted account is refused; its pools are still read and its grant
 * corrected, for the record.
 *
 * Nothing here mails anyone, calls GitHub, or is a cron.
