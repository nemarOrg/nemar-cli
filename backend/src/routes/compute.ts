/**
 * The compute gateway's routes, mounted at `/compute` (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118).
 *
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/bundle             the launcher, with its job token (no session)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/outputs            the launcher, with its job token (no session)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/outputs/complete   the launcher, with its job token (no session)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/cancel             the job's owner, signed in: cancel it
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/links              the job's owner, signed in: 7-day links to the results,
 *                                             1,000 at a time (an optional `{ "after": path }` body pages on)
 *   POST /compute/observer                    the observer, with a token for one run (phase A7, #2012;
 *                                             no session: see `routes/callbacks/compute-observer.ts`)
 *
 * The callbacks are registered FIRST and carry no middleware of their own beyond the Worker's global
 * ones: the launcher has no account. Every route that has a person behind it declares its own
 * authentication ON THE ROUTE (`authMiddleware`, then `cookieOriginGuard`, which a write made with a
 * session cookie must pass): there is no `use("*")` here, which would put a session in front of a
 * launcher. `backend/test/compute-route-inventory.test.ts` pins every entry of this router.
 *
 * THE OWNER ONLY. A job is the person's own: any other signed-in account, an administrator included
 * (an administrator has `/admin/compute/jobs/:id/cancel`), is answered `job_not_found`, which never
 * says whether the job exists for someone else. Neither route reads the compute switch: a person can
 * always cancel what is running and fetch what they have been given.
