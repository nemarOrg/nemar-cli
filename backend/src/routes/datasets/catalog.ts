 * Epic #1144 phase 3 (#1147), D7: every column the facet filter table binds
 * to must also be projected -- raw, un-COALESCEd so NULL stays NULL -- or a
 * user could filter on a fact they can never see the value of (the D7
 * describe block in backend/test/facet-table-correspondence.unit.test.ts
 * enforces this). One shared fragment so
 * both `GET /datasets` branches (the `?mine` shape, formerly 28 columns, and
 * the public shape, formerly 33) stay in lockstep rather than drifting apart
 * as two hand-copied column lists.
 *
 * `subject_count` and `file_size` are here for a reason worth stating,
 * because they look redundant (#1177 integration review). Both are ALSO
 * projected as `COALESCE(..., 0) AS participants` / `AS file_size`, a display
 * convention that predates this epic and that the website depends on. Phase 3
 * then made both filterable facets whose nullTest treats NULL as "unknown",
 * so `include_unknown=1` deliberately returns rows whose value was never
 * measured -- and the COALESCE rendered every one of them as a confident `0`,
 * indistinguishable from a measured zero. That is the exact "unknown reported
 * as a value" failure ADR 0005 and ADR 0032 exist to prevent, arrived at by
 * composing a pre-existing display convention with a new filter contract.
 *
 * The raw columns are additive, so the COALESCEd aliases keep working for
 * existing consumers. Do not "simplify" by dropping either half: the aliases
 * are the wire contract, these are the honest values.
