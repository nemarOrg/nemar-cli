/**
 * The compute gateway's routes, mounted at `/compute` (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118).
 *
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/bundle             the launcher, with its job token (no session)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/outputs            the launcher, with its job token (no session)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/outputs/complete   the launcher, with its job token (no session)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/cancel             the job's owner, signed in: cancel it (a job that had already
 *                                             ended answers 200 with its state and `cancelled: false`)
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/links              the job's owner, signed in: 7-day links to the results,
 *                                             1,000 at a time (an optional `{ "after": path }` body pages on)
 *   POST /compute/jobs, /jobs/:id/finalize, GET /jobs/:id/logs, /jobs/:id/results, POST /jobs/:id/results/renew
 *                                             the person's submission, log and results (`./jobs.ts`, phase D3, #2024)
 *   POST /compute/holds, /jobs/:id/report, DELETE /holds/:id
 *                                             the partner's reserve, report and release (`./partner.ts`,
 *                                             phase D4, #2025): an access token with `compute.reserve`
 *   POST /compute/observer                    the observer, with a token for one run (phase A7, #2012;
 *                                             no session: see `routes/callbacks/compute-observer.ts`)
 *   GET  /compute/me                          the caller's access, pools, limits and queue estimates
 *   GET  /compute/me/usage                    the caller's net charge by day, app, partition and source
 *   GET  /compute/me/jobs                     the caller's jobs, newest first, paged
 *   GET  /compute/me/jobs/:id                 one of the caller's jobs (a live one refreshed from Tapis)
 *   GET  /compute/stats                       platform-wide aggregates, for a partner's CLIENT
 *                                             (the read routes: `./read.ts`, phase D2, #2023; their
 *                                             credential rule, a key, the cookie or an access token with
 *                                             `compute.read` for `/me*` and a client credentials token
 *                                             with `compute.stats` for `/stats`: `./auth.ts`)
 *
 * The callbacks are registered FIRST and carry no middleware of their own beyond the Worker's global
 * ones: the launcher has no account. Every route that has a person behind it declares its own
 * authentication ON THE ROUTE (`authMiddleware`, then `cookieOriginGuard`, which a write made with a
 * session cookie must pass; the read routes' own rule is `./auth.ts`): there is no `use("*")` here,
 * which would put a session in front of a launcher. `backend/test/compute-route-inventory.test.ts` pins every entry of this router.
 *
 * THE ANSWERS ARE CONTRACTS. `shared/contract/compute-responses.ts` declares the answers of `cancel`,
 * `links` and the observer as open schemas, and `backend/test/compute-person-responses.test.ts` parses the
 * real output against them. The wire is snake_case throughout.
 *
 * NO CLI COMMAND FOR `cancel` AND `links` YET. They are a person's routes, and a person's front doors are
 * the website's job page and `nemar compute submit`, both Epic D (#2024 is the submit command; the job
 * page is nemarOrg/website#495). An administrator cancels with `nemar admin compute jobs cancel`. A
 * command added here belongs to that epic, built on the contract above.
 *
 * THE OWNER ONLY. A job is the person's own: any other signed-in account, an administrator included
 * (an administrator has `/admin/compute/jobs/:id/cancel`), is answered `job_not_found`, which never
 * says whether the job exists for someone else. Neither route reads the compute switch: a person can
 * always cancel what is running and fetch what they have been given.
