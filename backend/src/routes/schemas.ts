/**
 * Public JSON Schema documents: `GET /schemas/<name>.json`.
 *
 * The Zarr serving index is the mandatory entry point to the whole Zarr layer
 * (anonymous in-prefix ListBucket is denied on the serving bucket), and until
 * issue #1059 it was entirely undocumented -- every field was discoverable only
 * by probing a live object, so external clients were coupling to a shape nobody
 * had written down. Serving the schema from a stable URL is what lets
 * docs.nemar.org and any client point at a versioned contract instead.
 *
 * Static and D1-free by design: the bytes are the repo's own
 * `shared/zarr-index.schema.json`, imported at build time, so this route cannot
 * drift from the schema the converter validates against before upload
 * (scripts/zarr/generate_zarr.py's `validate_document`). One file, two readers.
 *
 * Versioned in the PATH, not by content negotiation: a schema is a contract, and
 * a client that pinned v3 must keep getting v3 when v4 exists. A new format
 * version adds a route; it never edits this one in place.
