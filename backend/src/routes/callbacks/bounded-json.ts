/**
 * Read a callback's JSON object body under a size bound, before anything in it
 * is trusted (epic #1610). The two identifier-screen callbacks, the publication
 * request's and the scheduled sweep's, both take a report from a workflow; a
 * real report is a few kilobytes, so anything near the bound is not one, and
 * reading it would only spend the Worker's memory on an attacker's payload.
 *
 * Bounded twice: by the declared length, and by the bytes that actually arrive
 * (a declared length can be absent or wrong). The second bound is a counted read
 * of the stream, not a size check on a buffer that was already filled: a body
 * without a length (chunked) would otherwise be held whole, up to the platform's
 * request limit, before anything looked at it, and this door is open to anyone
 * until the token has been checked. The read stops and cancels the stream at the
 * bound. The answers are fixed words.
