/**
 * The launcher's three job callbacks (epic #2005 phase A5, #2010; ADR 0118; design section 7, "The
 * launcher on Expanse" and "The launch specification"):
 *
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/bundle             a 10-minute presigned GET of THIS job's own code bundle
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/outputs            what the job produced, and an upload address for each file
 *   POST /compute/jobs/:id/outputs/complete   the uploads are done
 *
 * They are registered on the compute router with no session: the launcher runs on a node, holds no
 * account and no storage credential, and authenticates with ONE per-job token.
 *
 * THE TOKEN is the launch specification's `job_token`, an HMAC (domain tag `compute-job`) over the job
 * and its `webhook_nonce`, sent in the header `X-Compute-Job-Token` and NEVER in a URL (a token in a
 * URL reaches logs, and a token in the address of a request that has no header is refused like any
 * other). It is checked in constant time against the job's nonce, and it stops working the moment the
 * job is TERMINAL (the extra day the webhook address lives is for the webhook only): a launcher that
 * outlives its job, a cancelled one included, is refused.
 *
 * EVERY REFUSAL OF THE TOKEN IS ONE ANSWER, the same status and body on all three routes: a wrong
 * token, another job's token, a cleared nonce, a terminal job, no header, a malformed job id and a job
 * that does not exist (and, for `bundle`, a job that has no bundle). The door says nothing about which
 * jobs exist or why it refused. Only then, for a verified token, are the other answers given.
 *
 * The bundle address is made by `presignBundleRead`, from the job id the token was verified for and
 * nothing the request carries: no path, no key and no query is read, so there is nothing to steer it to
 * another record. Bodies are bounded (1 MiB for `bundle` and `complete`, which need none; the outputs
 * route derives its bound from the owner's `maxFiles`, never under 1 MiB, see `outputsBodyLimitBytes`).
 *
 * Nothing here logs a token, an address or a path: a line carries the job id and a fixed word.
