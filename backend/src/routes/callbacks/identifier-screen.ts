/**
 * Identifier-screen callback: POST /identifier-screen-result, called by the
 * `run-identifier-screen` workflow (epic #1610, phase 4).
 *
 * Authed like the pre-screen callback: a per-request HMAC token in
 * X-Webhook-Token, signed over {dataset_id, request_id, nonce} with
 * PRESCREEN_CALLBACK_SECRET under the identifier-screen domain tag, whose nonce
 * is recovered from the row the token was issued for. One-shot: the row is
 * looked up only while its screen is `pending`, and storing a result clears the
 * nonce, so a replay or a late callback finds nothing to verify and gets 401.
 *
 * Body: `{ dataset_id, request_id, workflow_run_id?, report }`. Every field is
 * untrusted. `dataset_id` and `request_id` are validated against their exact
 * shapes BEFORE they are used or logged, `workflow_run_id` is logged only when
 * it is a run number, and `report` reaches nothing except through
 * `parseScreenReport` (services/identifier-screen.ts). A route that echoed a
 * body field into a log line would be a way for a header's text to reach the
 * Worker's logs, which is the thing this feature exists to keep out.
