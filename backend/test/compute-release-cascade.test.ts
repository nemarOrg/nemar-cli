/**
 * Ending an account ends its compute (epic #2005 phase A8, #2013; AGENTS.md, "Revocation cascades,
 * always"; ADR 0118; design section 7): `computeReleaseStatements` runs in the batch of BOTH callers
 * that end every credential of an account, `finalizeRevocation` (admin revoke, by username and by id)
 * and `tombstoneUserCascade` (the owner-only soft delete and the scheduled sweep of the live tests'
 * accounts, which run the same function), and in no other.
 *
 * Every case drives the REAL route (or the real `tombstoneUserCascade`) over a real migrated database
 * carrying real jobs made through `createJob`, real holds and real pools; the Tapis tenant is the A4
 * stand-in (a real HTTP server built from Tapis's published specifications; NO RESPONSE IN IT WAS
 * RECORDED FROM A REAL TENANT) behind the A5 forwarding proxy, and the cancel that follows the batch is
 * made by the real `sweepComputeCancellations`. Nothing here replaces a NEMAR decision.
 *
 * What is pinned, each with a test of its own:
 *  - a job NOT YET AT TAPIS, provably so (no Tapis job, no launch specification written, no live submit
 *    lease), is cancelled with `cancel_reason = 'account_ended'` and its hold released in the SAME batch;
 *  - a job at Tapis, or one a submit may have reached (a lost answer wrote its launch specification; a
 *    submitter holds the lease), is NOT ended in SQL: it records `account_ended` and the intent to
 *    cancel, keeps its hold, and the retried sweep cancels it AT TAPIS (a Tapis call never runs inside
 *    the batch: the stand-in's log is empty between the batch and the sweep);
 *  - every pool of the account is frozen (a new hold is refused `suspended`), no other account's is;
 *  - a job that already ended, and another account's live job, are untouched;
 *  - the first recorded cancel reason stands (a person's earlier cancel stays `user`);
 *  - the guarded call of the scheduled sweep (`onlyIfEmail`) changes NOTHING in compute when its guard
 *    is false, statement by statement: every release statement ends in a WHERE clause;
 *  - a role demotion and a key revocation do NOT end compute (a person who is no longer an admin, or
 *    who revoked one key, still has an account and its jobs);
 *  - the statements are replayable: a second run writes nothing.
 * MUTATIONS, each run alone: remove the statements from `finalizeRevocation`; remove them from
 * `tombstoneUserCascade`; drop the `launch_spec_digest IS NULL` or the lease term of the SQL cancel;
 * drop the freeze; drop the account scope of a statement; drop `COALESCE` of the reason.
