/**
 * Discovery stays id-only, and the re-pull never reaches it (epic #1046 phases 4 and 7, #1910 and
 * #1913; ADR 0111, decision 6).
 *
 * Decision 6: "`diffNewDatasets` stays id-only, so the live auto-import never sees a stale
 * mirror; staleness is computed by its own report." `AUTO_IMPORT_ENABLED` is on in production, so
 * nothing a re-pull needs may reach the auto-import's candidate set, and the automatic re-pull's
 * scheduler, which reads the staleness report, must not reach discovery's set-diff either.
 *
 * A source scan on the syntax tree (`helpers/ts-scan.ts`, as `repull-no-mail-scan.test.ts` does):
 * the transitive import closures of the auto-import and of discovery hold no re-pull or staleness
 * module, and the closures of the staleness report (and of the scheduler that reads it) hold
 * neither the auto-import nor discovery. The two share OpenNeuro's endpoint through a leaf that
 * imports nothing (`services/openneuro-endpoint.ts`). Each rule is proven to fire on a planted
 * import.
