/**
 * The lifecycle's submit, cancel and rotation under concurrency and under failure (epic #2005 phase A5,
 * #2010; ADR 0118), round 1 of the review of PR #2041. Real migrations, the real ledger, Miniflare's R2,
 * the Tapis stand-in (no response of which was recorded from a real tenant) behind a forwarding proxy
 * that can drop the answer to a submit AFTER the stand-in has acted on it, and the real services.
 *
 * What is pinned, each with a test of its own:
 *  - the 30-minute tick cannot starve: more than ten rows that cannot be read, or ten `created` rows that
 *    cannot be submitted, never keep a healthy running job from being read; rotation is by EXAMINATION,
 *    and the bound rows and the `created` rows have a quota each (MUTATION: order by the last good read;
 *    one shared list); with compute off a `created` row still reaches `submit_timeout`;
 *  - two submitters cannot both reach Tapis (the lease), and a submitter whose bind lost does not cancel
 *    the Tapis job another path bound to the SAME row (MUTATION: drop the lease; drop the re-read); a
 *    Tapis job no row owns is recorded and cancelled again by the tick until it is cancelled (MUTATION:
 *    do not record it); a cancel pending while the submit is in flight keeps the row from `submitted`
 *    (MUTATION: drop `cancel_requested_at IS NULL` from the bind);
 *  - a cancel of an unbound job whose submit may have reached Tapis asks Tapis FIRST, and releases the
 *    hold only when nothing is there (MUTATION: end the row at once); when Tapis cannot be asked the
 *    cancel stays recorded and nothing is released;
 *  - a terminal hint that loses to a concurrent live write is applied again against the fresh row
 *    (MUTATION: no retry), and a job found by tag is applied from the FULL record, so its exit code is
 *    checked (MUTATION: apply the search record).
