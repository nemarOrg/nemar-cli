/**
 * The five points phase A5 left open for phase A7 (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118), each with a test
 * that fails on the old behavior. Real migrations, the real ledger, Miniflare's R2 and the Tapis
 * stand-in (nothing from which was recorded from a real tenant).
 *
 *  - the two terminal repair lists, the orphan list and the cancel list ROTATE: a row that cannot make
 *    progress goes to the back, and the eleventh row is reached on the second tick;
 *  - a row has one orphan slot, and a second orphan is logged and flagged, not lost silently (the tenant
 *    sweep cancels any duplicate it lists, which `compute-sweep.test.ts` pins);
 *  - a terminal row whose Tapis record is gone, or has been unreadable for a week, is settled without it;
 *  - a cancel recorded on staging is carried out by `advance` (the cancel sweep is production-only).
 *
 * The sixth point, that the 30-minute tick equals the default reservation wait, is not changed: it is the
 * owner's policy (`reservationWaitMinutes`), and a value under two ticks gives a `created` job one retry;
 * the PR and the implementation notes say so.
