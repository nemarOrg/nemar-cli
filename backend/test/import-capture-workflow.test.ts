/**
 * The capture half of issue #1309, checked against the classify half.
 *
 * `nemarDatasets/.github`'s `onboard-openneuro.yml` posts the failing phase's real
 * error line; `classifyImportFailure` turns that text into a cause. The two halves
 * live in different repositories and are joined only by the WORDING of a message, so
 * nothing in either repo's own tests can catch them drifting apart. That is what this
 * file is for.
 *
 * Two things are pinned:
 *
 *   1. The messages the workflow actually produces classify to the causes triage
 *      needs. The strings below are not invented: each was extracted by running the
 *      workflow's own shell pipeline over a log in the shape the CLI writes.
 *   2. The workflow file kept in this repo (`.github/dataset-workflows/`) still has
 *      the properties the capture depends on. It is a copy that an owner deploys by
 *      hand, so a well-meaning edit here is the likeliest way for capture to regress.
 *
 * Before this, every machine-filed tracking issue read `terminal: prepare=failure
 * copy=failure finalize=failure` -- a stage roll-up with no error text -- and a human
 * read Actions logs and applied labels by hand.
