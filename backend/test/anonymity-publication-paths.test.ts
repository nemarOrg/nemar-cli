/**
 * Every path to public stamps the publication (#1407, epic #1406).
 *
 * The triggers in migration 0085 refuse to make a PUBLISHED dataset
 * anonymous, and they decide that by reading `first_published_at`. So the
 * invariant is exactly as strong as the set of code paths that write that
 * column, and the first version of this phase had one writer against three
 * paths that make a dataset public. A dataset published with `nemar admin
 * make-public` kept the column NULL, and could then be made anonymous
 * afterwards -- DOI minted, landing page indexed, git history cloned, and D1
 * reporting a never-published anonymous deposit. That is the state ADR 0063
 * calls theater, reached through the door the ADR was written to close.
 *
 * Two kinds of test here, because neither is sufficient alone. The
 * source-level scan catches a FOURTH path added later, which no runtime test
 * over today's routes could ever reach. The real-database tests prove the SQL
 * those paths interpolate actually does what its name says, including the
 * case the whole design turns on: an anonymous deposit going public without
 * being stamped.
