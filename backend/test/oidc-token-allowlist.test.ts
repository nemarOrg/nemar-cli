/**
 * An OpenID Connect access token authenticates NOTHING outside the OIDC routes (epic #2014 phase
 * #2018; ADR 0119 rule 4).
 *
 * The request list is the Worker's own route table (`__workerRouteTable`), not a list written here,
 * so a route added later is called by this test the day it exists. Every route is called twice
 * through the REAL Worker, once with a live access token minted by the real flow (for an account that
 * passes every rule, holding every scope a person can grant) and once with an unknown key of the API
 * key's shape, and the two answers must agree: the same status, the same body for a success (the
 * anonymous answer), and the same kind of refusal otherwise. Wherever the unknown key meets the
 * API-key refusal, the access token must meet the OIDC one (`oidc_token_not_accepted`), which is what
 * proves the token was recognized and refused rather than looked up as a key. And no answer to the
 * access token may carry anything of its account.
 *
 * The OIDC routes themselves are the allowlist: discovery, the key set and the four `/oauth`
 * endpoints. `oidcBearer` is checked by reference on the same table: it may sit only on userinfo.
