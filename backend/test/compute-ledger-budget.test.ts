/**
 * The `people` budget records consumption only (epic #2005, follow-up to phase A2, #2007; ADR 0118,
 * item 5 of the A2 amendment as the owner's decision of 2026-11-04 settled it: option A).
 *
 * The budget is the overall cap on what people can spend, so it counts what was consumed and nothing
 * a person or an administrator does to a person's pool gives it back. Against the real migration on a
 * real database (bun:sqlite behind `realD1`), what is pinned is:
 *  - a correction that LOWERS the charge of an account's or a partner's pool lowers the pool and
 *    leaves the budget's consumption exactly as it was, and the service refuses a caller that names
 *    the budget for it; one that RAISES the charge raises both; a correction of the grant moves
 *    neither the budget's charged nor its held;
 *  - the only entry that names the budget and lowers its charged is a job's final settlement, which
 *    corrects a figure that was recorded as consumption, and it can never take the budget below what
 *    the other jobs consumed;
 *  - an enumerated table of every operation the service has, run against every kind the vocabulary
 *    allows, says which of them lowers the budget (one) and a ledger scan says the same of every
 *    entry written;
 *  - the refund path is gone.
 *
 * The guards this file and its neighbours hold, each proven by mutating it alone and watching a test
 * of the file named fail:
 *  - `adjustPool` refuses a lowering charge correction that names the budget (here, and the random
 *    sequence and the D1 life of a job in compute-ledger.test.ts and compute-ledger-race.test.ts);
 *  - `ADJUST_INSERT_SQL` writes nothing for a budget with a charged change that does not raise it
 *    (the statement bound directly, here);
 *  - the route names the budget only when `delta_milli > 0` (compute-pool-routes.test.ts and the
 *    admin compute CLI test);
 *  - the final settlement's delta is the job's own, so it cannot take back other jobs' consumption
 *    (here), and it names the budget (here, and the final-settlement suites);
 *  - the per-step check of the random sequence, that no step lowers the budget but a final
 *    settlement or the owner's platform correction (compute-ledger.test.ts);
 *  - the source scan that refuses a shipped ledger insert that writes `refund` or a kind it cannot
 *    read, and the export check that the refund function, statement and key are gone (here);
 *  - the vocabulary check that every ledger kind but `refund` is written by a row of the table (here);
 *  - the `pool adjust` help text that says what lowers the budget (admin-compute-cli.test.ts).
