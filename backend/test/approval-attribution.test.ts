/**
 * Who a publication is recorded as approved by (ADR 0080).
 *
 * Attribution forks. A terminal approval records the account that called
 * `/approve`, as it always has. A web approval is executed by a workflow that
 * authenticates with its own service key, so recording the caller would name the
 * bot for every one of them; instead the admin who clicked Approve on the
 * website, whom the dispatch route stored in `approval_requested_by`, is the
 * approver, and the executing account is kept as `executed_by` in the audit
 * details.
 *
 * Driven through the real routes, not the helper: `/approve` runs the resume
 * path (only the two logged no-op steps remain, as in
 * publication-approve-golden.test.ts) so no external service is touched, and one
 * case chains the real dispatch route into it. Real engine only: bun:sqlite
 * behind realD1 with every migration applied, the real auth middleware, and a
 * `Bun.serve()` stand-in for api.github.com for the one dispatch.
 *
 * Each request carries a clean identifier screen of the commit the stand-in
 * reports as `main` (epic #1610 phase 4), because the gate runs before the
 * approver is recorded; the gate itself is pinned in
 * identifier-screen-gate.test.ts.
