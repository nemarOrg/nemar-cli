/**
 * The retention sweep, legal holds and the anonymising update (epic #2005 phase A7, #2012; ADR 0118, the
 * amendment of 2026-11-04; design section 9). Real migrations (0118 and 0130 included), the real ledger
 * with its triggers, and Miniflare's R2 reached through the Worker's own bindings.
 *
 * THE ONE BOUNDARY FAKE. Miniflare does not enforce a bucket lock, so a records bucket whose `delete`
 * refuses the keys the lock still covers is a thin wrapper around the real bucket (`lockedBucket`): it
 * throws, with whatever text, when asked to delete a locked key and otherwise does what the real bucket
 * does. Everything else, the listing included, is the real bucket. The refusal text of a real R2 lock was
 * not recorded, which is why the sweep counts ANY throw from `delete` as `locked`.
 *
 * What is pinned, each with a test of its own:
 *  - records and logs past retention are deleted and the index row reduced to anonymous counts; a LIVE job
 *    is never touched; a job hold and an account hold each keep a job's records; a released hold lets the
 *    next run delete (MUTATION: do not read the hold before deleting);
 *  - any refusal of a locked key is counted `locked` whatever its text, leaves the job whole, and is tried
 *    again the next day (MUTATION: count only a refusal whose text names a lock);
 *  - logs go early for an unflagged, unheld job, and a flagged job keeps them with its records;
 *  - a results object still present a day after the window is deleted and counted `late`, and a hold
 *    never keeps a result;
 *  - a deleted account's pools and ledger actors are anonymised through migration 0130's one exception
 *    and nothing else is: a total does not move, a live account's rows are refused, an open hold waits;
 *  - only exact production runs it, the audit row is one row of counts, and the log line has counts only.
