/**
 * A `Bun.serve()` stand-in for the api.github.com reads and the one dispatch a re-pull's Worker
 * routes make (epic #1046 phase 6, #1912), installed through NEMAR_GITHUB_API_URL the way the
 * other backend suites install theirs. Not a mock of NEMAR code: every NEMAR component runs, and
 * only GitHub is stood in for, because the organization is shared with production.
 *
 * It answers:
 *  - `GET /repos/nemarDatasets/<id>/pulls/<n>`: an entry of `pulls` (`<id>#<n>`), or, with
 *    `defaultHead` set, an open, unmerged pull request at that head from the release branch the
 *    repull-rows fixtures record (`release/v2.0.0` for #7, `release/v2.0.1` for #8);
 *  - `GET .../commits/tags/<tag>`: the commit in `tags` (`<id>@<tag>`) as a bare id when the
 *    request asks for `application/vnd.github.sha`, as `{ sha }` otherwise; 422 when absent;
 *  - `GET .../compare/<base>...<head>`: `{ status }` from `compares` (`<id>:<base>...<head>`),
 *    `ahead` by default, or that HTTP status when the entry is a number;
 *  - `POST /repos/nemarDatasets/.github/dispatches`: recorded in `dispatches`, answered
 *    `dispatchStatus`;
 *  - `GET .../git/ref/heads/main`: the commit in `mainRefs` (`<id>`) as a ref object, or that HTTP
 *    status when the entry is a number; 404 when absent;
 *  - `GET .../commits/<sha>/check-runs`: the runs in `checkRuns` (`<id>@<sha>`), filtered by the
 *    query's `check_name` and `app_id` as GitHub filters them (unless `checkFiltersIgnored`, a
 *    GitHub that ignored them), or that HTTP status when the entry is a number; none when absent;
 *    `checkTotalCount` makes the list claim more runs than it holds (a page that is not all);
 *  - `POST .../check-runs`, `PATCH .../check-runs/<n>`, `POST .../issues/<n>/comments` and
 *    `PATCH .../issues/comments/<n>`, the writes the ADR 0107 review publishes its check and its
 *    comment with: recorded in `writes` and answered with a new id;
 *  - `PUT .../pulls/<n>/merge`, the Worker's merge of an automatic re-pull: recorded in `merges`
 *    (its body and the token it carried), with `beforeMerge` run first (a test reads the database
 *    there, at the moment the merge arrives). As GitHub does, it answers 409 when the `sha` it was
 *    sent is not the pull request's head, and otherwise merges the entry of `pulls` (merged,
 *    closed, `STANDIN_MERGE_SHA` its merge commit) and answers `{ merged: true }`; `mergeAnswer`
 *    answers another status instead (with `applied`, the merge is made all the same: an answer
 *    lost after GitHub merged), or a 200 whose body does not say it merged.
 * A pull request entry may also name its `number`, `user` and `mergeable_state`, which are answered
 * only when named, and the head's and base's `repo`, which are the dataset's own when not named, as
 * GitHub always names both (`null` stands for a deleted fork's head). A request whose path holds
 * `slow` is answered `slowMs` late. Error answers on the reads added for the machine-clean facts
 * carry `Retry-After: 0`, so a retry does not wait. `pullReadFailures` (`<id>#<n>`) answers that
 * many reads of the pull request 503, with `Retry-After: 0`, before it answers again, so one
 * reader's read fails while a later reader's succeeds. `down` answers every request 503. Every
 * request is recorded in `requests`, and with its query in `urls`.
