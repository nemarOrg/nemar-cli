/**
 * The scheduler's launch file and a shell that sources it (epic #2005, contract follow-up A1c, #2043).
 *
 * THE HAZARD this reproduces. The launch specification travels as ONE scheduler environment value.
 * The scheduler writes an environment value into a file that a shell sources on the compute node, and
 * it quotes the value only conditionally: left bare unless it contains a space or one of `&`, `>`,
 * `<`, `|`, `;` or a backtick, and then wrapped in double quotes with only `"` escaped. That rule is
 * the one the review of the launcher phase recorded; it is UNVERIFIED against a real scheduler, and
 * these helpers do not claim to be one. They are the rule, written out, so a test can put a value
 * through it and through a real `sh` and see what comes back.
 *
 * What it shows, and what the tests built on it rely on. Compact JSON is not shell-inert: a value
 * with no space is written bare, and the shell then removes the quotes of the JSON (bash also splits
 * it at the commas); a value with a space is double-quoted, and the shell then still expands `$(...)`,
 * `$NAME` and a backtick inside it, and reads two backslashes, and a backslash before a quote, as
 * escapes. A base64url value (`A-Za-z0-9-_`) holds none of the characters the rule quotes for and
 * none the shell treats as special, so it comes back byte for byte.
 *
 * `sourceLaunchFile` runs a real `sh` in a fresh sandbox directory (its working directory, and the only
 * place the commands the tests use ever write): the adversarial strings are inert examples, a `touch`
 * of a path inside that directory. The directory is listed afterwards, so a file made by ANY command
 * in the value, at an absolute path or a relative one, is seen.
 *
 * What `sh` is differs by machine (bash in its POSIX mode on macOS, dash on most Linux), and no
 * assertion built on this depends on which it is: `NEMAR_TEST_SH` names another shell to run the same
 * assertions under (dash, ksh, bash).
