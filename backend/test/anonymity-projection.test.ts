/**
 * The owner projection stays in one place (#1407, epic #1406).
 *
 * A source-level assertion, in the same shape as the one
 * `test/data-summary-route.test.ts` uses to keep the summary route a
 * passthrough. It exists because of what ADR 0017 already concedes about
 * visibility scoping: "every new list, search, or catalog endpoint inherits
 * the obligation ... getting one wrong reopens the hole." The obligation here
 * is narrower and easier to discharge -- withhold the owner when the dataset
 * is anonymous -- but it has the same failure mode, which is a sixth query
 * added later that spells the join out by hand and quietly names a depositor
 * who paid for concealment. A runtime test cannot catch that: a new endpoint
 * that leaks is new code, and no assertion about the existing endpoints would
 * run against it.
 *
 * WHAT IS SCANNED, AND WHY NOT LESS
 * ---------------------------------
 * The first version of this file matched one exact alias spelling,
 * `u.username AS owner_username`. A reviewer pointed out that
 * `SELECT u.username, u.github_username` -- the spelling
 * `routes/datasets/collaborators.ts` already uses -- sails straight past it,
 * as do `u.username AS uploader` and `SELECT d.*, u.*`. So the scan now looks
 * for any dataset-scoped SQL statement that reads a username off the `users`
 * table, whatever it calls the result.
 *
 * It is scoped to statements mentioning `datasets` / `dataset_collaborators`
 * rather than to every `u.username` in the backend, because matching them all
 * flags twenty-odd auth and account-management files that have nothing to do
 * with dataset projections -- an allowlist nobody would read, appended to by
 * reflex, which is how a guard stops guarding.
