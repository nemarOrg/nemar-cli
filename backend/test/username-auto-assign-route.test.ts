/**
 * Username assignment at web sign-in (#1268, ADR 0045).
 *
 * ADR 0042 built the batch path: an admin sweep names the accounts whose
 * `username IS NULL`. It has not been run yet, and when it is it closes the
 * accounts that exist at that moment and nothing after them — a web sign-up
 * whose owner abandons onboarding lands right back in that state.
 * Phase 8 adds the lazy path at the three doors a web account comes through,
 * and this file drives all three for real:
 *
 *   POST /auth/code/verify     the emailed-code sign-in (assignment batched
 *                              into the sign-in's own transaction)
 *   POST /auth/orcid/finalize  the ORCID sign-up
 *   GET  /auth/orcid/callback  the ORCID sign-in of an already-linked account
 *
 * The two ORCID paths assign AFTER the response, chained behind the ORCID name
 * refresh they depend on, so those tests wait for the row rather than for the
 * response — a real wait on real async work, not a mock of it.
 *
 * Real engine throughout: bun:sqlite behind realD1 with every migration
 * applied, real Hono dispatch, real session issuance, the production
 * `hashAuthCode`, and local `Bun.serve()` instances standing in for ORCID's
 * token endpoint and public record API. No mocks.
