/**
 * No re-pull route or service sends mail (epic #1046 phases 6 and 7, #1912 and #1913; ADR 0111,
 * decision 6 and the Phase 6 amendment), the automatic path's dispatch record, its callback and
 * its scheduler included. The dev database holds real addresses, so the record of a re-pull is
 * read by an administrator with `nemar admin repull status`, and nothing here may reach a person.
 *
 * A source scan on the syntax tree, as `repull-lineage-writer-scan.test.ts` does for the lineage
 * word: the transitive import closure of the service and of the routes may contain no mail module
 * (every file under `backend/src` whose name says email, mail or resend), and no file in it may
 * name a mail binding or call a sender. Each rule is proven to fire on a planted violation.
 * What this pins is the code the re-pull loads at run time; it cannot see a mail sent by a module
 * a future import pulls in unless that module is in the closure, which is exactly what it checks.
