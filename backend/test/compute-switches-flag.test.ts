/**
 * The compute gateway's two dark switches, and where they are NOT set (epic #2005 phase A4, #2009;
 * ADR 0118 decision 8).
 *
 * `COMPUTE_ENABLED` and `COMPUTE_PIPELINES_DISPATCH_ENABLED` appear in no table of
 * `backend/wrangler-sccn.toml`, so the file turns compute on nowhere. The owner adds them in a
 * reviewed change after the first real job has run by hand; a line added by any other change would
 * turn compute on somewhere nobody decided it should be, and that is what this test refuses. It is
 * pinned until that change, which edits this test.
 *
 * The Tapis credentials and the tenant they name are not in the file either: a tenant name is not
 * public, so they are Worker secrets or owner-set variables, and the file's comment block lists their
 * names only (comments are not parsed, so a name in a comment passes). The same walk covers them.
 *
 * The test reads the real file and parses it with Bun's TOML parser, then walks every table of the
 * parsed document, not only the vars blocks, so a name misplaced under another table (a binding, an
 * observability block) fails here too. It covers the file and nothing else: a Worker secret of the
 * same name also takes effect and does not show in the file, so a green run here is not proof that a
 * switch is off in an environment; `GET /admin/compute/status` reports what the Worker reads.
 *
 * It also pins the switch rule itself, through the real functions: a switch reads as on only as the
 * exact string "1", and only in exactly `production` or `development`.
