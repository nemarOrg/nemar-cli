/**
 * The ACCESS reporter (epic #2005 phase A8, #2013; ADR 0118 decision 9; design section 9): it sends each
 * Slurm job's gateway attributes to ACCESS ONCE, under the stored pseudonym, from the 30-minute tick.
 * The rows it works on are made by the lifecycle (`compute-access-reports.test.ts`); here the jobs are
 * driven through the real lifecycle over the Tapis stand-in (a real HTTP server built from Tapis's
 * published specifications; NO RESPONSE IN IT WAS RECORDED FROM A REAL TENANT), and the ACCESS endpoint
 * is a real HTTP server too (`helpers/access-standin.ts`; NO RESPONSE IN IT WAS RECORDED FROM THE REAL
 * SERVICE). THE KEY HEADER NAME AND THE SPELLING OF THE BODY ARE UNVERIFIED: a test that pins a
 * spelling pins what the phase issue wrote, and says so; the owner confirms them against the real
 * interface when the key is issued.
 *
 * THE GUARANTEE, and what it is not. Towards ACCESS the reporter is AT MOST ONCE per job for every
 * outcome it cannot judge, and retries only what ACCESS visibly did not record:
 *  - the row is CLAIMED by one conditional UPDATE (`pending` to `attempting`, a lease stamp, the attempt
 *    counted) BEFORE the POST, so two overlapping runs cannot both send (MUTATION: send without the
 *    claim: the stand-in sees two requests);
 *  - an answer of 2xx is `sent`; a status that refuses or defers (3xx, 4xx, 408, 429, 5xx) means ACCESS
 *    did not record it, so the row is `pending` again with an exponential delay and `failed` only when
 *    the attempts run out;
 *  - NO ANSWER (a timeout, a lost connection, a refused connection) may mean the request was recorded:
 *    the row is `failed` with `outcome_unknown` and code never sends it again (MUTATION: retry it: the
 *    stand-in sees a second request); a sender that died holding its lease is the same, once the lease
 *    ends (a reaper, MUTATION: remove it and the row stays `attempting` for ever);
 *  - a sender writes its outcome only under its own lease stamp, so a reaped sender cannot overwrite the
 *    truth (MUTATION: drop the stamp from the outcome statements).
 * What is NOT guaranteed: that every job is reported. A report that may have been recorded and is not
 * known to have been is LOST, never doubled, and is `failed` with a fixed word for a person to resolve.
