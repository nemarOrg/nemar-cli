/**
 * What the rate limiter sees over a service binding, in real workerd (#1709, ADR 0098).
 *
 * The limiter counts a request without `CF-Connecting-IP` by the visitor its
 * caller forwards in `X-Forwarded-For`. That rests on a property of service
 * bindings, that a call over one arrives with no `CF-Connecting-IP`, and the
 * bun tests (`rate-limit-site-identity.test.ts`) can only assume it by leaving
 * the header off. This file asks workerd instead.
 *
 * The API Worker is bundled by the production bundler and run through Miniflare
 * (the harness ADR 0078 describes) with `ENVIRONMENT=production`, so the real
 * limiter runs against workerd's real Cache API. Beside it sit a caller Worker
 * holding a service binding to the DEFAULT entrypoint, which is what the
 * website will hold, and a small reporter Worker that says which headers reached
 * it, so the question is answered without the limiter in the way.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SHOW. Local workerd is not the Cloudflare edge. It says what
 * the workerd implementation of a service binding does, not what Cloudflare's
 * production network does, and the two can differ. The development Worker skips
 * the limiter entirely (`ENVIRONMENT=development`), so the keying below can be
 * seen on the production Worker and nowhere else. ADR 0098 says how to check it
 * after a deploy.
