Data-plane paths carry the `v`: `/{dataset_id}/v1.0.0/manifest.json` and
`/{dataset_id}/v1.0.0/<bidsPath>`. A bare `1.0.0` returns 404 `Version not found` for EVERY
dataset, including known-good published controls, so that 404 says nothing about the dataset
you are probing.

**Why:** I read a 404 on `/nm099998/1.0.0/dataset_description.json` as evidence the anonymous
fixture's broker path was broken, which would have been a real defect in ADR 0066's git-file
broker. Probing exemplar `xx099900` in both forms showed the control 404s on `1.0.0` and 200s
on `v1.0.0`, so the fault was in my URL. Hosts: `data-test.nemar.org` on dev
(`DATA_HOSTNAME`), `data.nemar.org` in production.

**How to apply:** Before diagnosing any data-plane 404, re-run the same request against a
public control dataset. If the control 404s too, fix the request, not the code. Same discipline
as [[s3-403-is-not-absence]] and [[openneuro-200-hides-every-failure]]: a status code only
means something once a control has told you what the healthy answer looks like.
