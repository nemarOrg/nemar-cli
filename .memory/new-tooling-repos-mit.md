Asked while initializing the mock ORCID server project (2026-09-08): nemar-cli carries Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0, which forbids reuse in a tool meant for everyone. Yahya: "I think MIT is good."

**Why:** a test double for a third-party API is only useful if other integrators can adopt and modify it; a no-derivatives license defeats that.

**How to apply:** when creating a new nemarOrg repository intended for reuse outside NEMAR, add an MIT LICENSE with "The Regents of the University of California" as the holder unless Yahya names another, and say in the README that it is MIT. Do not copy nemar-cli's LICENSE into tooling repos. See [[make-vs-take-decision-test]].
