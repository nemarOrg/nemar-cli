The `docs.nemar.org/admin/*` gate (epic #1336 phase 0) spans three repos, and two of them deploy on
different cadences. Getting the order wrong locks the admin docs shut with no way in.

- `nemarOrg/docs` is a git-connected Cloudflare Pages project: **merging to `main` IS the deploy**,
  immediately.
- `nemarOrg/website` hosts the sign-in page at `app.nemar.org/auth/docs/authorize`, and merging a PR
  only reaches `staging` / `test.nemar.org`. Production needs the separate promotion described in
  [[website-release-prepare-first]].
- The backend routes (`/auth/docs/{grant,exchange,verify}`) ship with nemar-cli releases.

**Why:** the gate 302s an unauthenticated visitor to `app.nemar.org/auth/docs/authorize`. If that
page is not in production, the redirect lands on a 404 and every admin page is unreachable.
Measured 2026-09-13: that path returned 404 on production while the gate was still unmerged.

**Still true after epic #1336 closed (2026-09-14), with one addition:** `nemarOrg/docs` is now
PRIVATE at source, so a CI job that checks it out needs `DOCS_READ_TOKEN`, and that token is NOT
available on fork pull requests. The checkout is conditioned on the PR coming from this repo for
exactly that reason; do not remove the condition. See [[docs-are-the-retrieval-surface]].

**How to apply:** website to production first, verify `curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'
https://app.nemar.org/auth/docs/authorize` is a redirect and not 404, and only then merge the docs
gate. Immediately after the docs merge run `bun run probe:gate` against `docs.nemar.org` — never a
preview, because Cloudflare Access covers this Pages project's preview deployments (and only those),
so an anonymous probe of a preview reports on Access rather than on the gate. The same ordering
applies to phase 3, which moves runbooks behind the gate. See [[verify-fix-against-known-broken]]:
that probe accepted 404 as "refused" and so passed against a completely ungated site until fixed.
