description: OSA's nemar assistant is the LEGACY one and its replacement was never built; where the chatbot actually stands versus ADR 0025 (dead legacy API, no MCP runtime, no code exec)

OSA is OpenScience-Collective/osa (its local checkout is usually parked on a stale branch, see [[osa-checkout-parked-on-feature-branch]]).
As of 2026-09-08 its NEMAR assistant (`src/assistants/nemar/`) still calls the legacy PHP `dataexplorer` data-pipeline API (404 now) and links the legacy `dataexplorer/detail` pages (a redirect now),
so the assistant is dead in production.
It is not hosted where ADR 0025 assumes; where it runs is not a NEMAR fact and is not recorded here.

**Do not confuse the two APIs** (checked 2026-09-15): OSA's own API answers 200 for the Open Science Assistant itself (with `nemar` among its communities),
while the LEGACY NEMAR API path on OSA's host now 404s.
NEMAR's API is `api.nemar.org`, which also answers on `/nemar` because the app is mounted twice
([[api-mounted-twice-full-path]]); a 200 there is NEMAR's own API, never OSA.

The config schema declares `mcp_servers` (remote `url`) but nothing in `src/` consumes it, and
there is no code-execution tool despite the README.

**`src/assistants/nemar/` is the OLD assistant, and its replacement was never built**
(the owner, 2026-09-15). There is no "NEMAR 2" assistant anywhere; building one is part of an epic
tied to the new tool-use capabilities, not a repointing of the legacy one. So treat the findings
above as a description of a legacy artifact, not as a repair list: do not propose fixing its dead
`dataexplorer` calls as the path to an MCP-consuming assistant.

**Why:** ADR 0025 and #1065 treat "OSA NEMAR assistant consumes the MCP" as a given; none of the
three gaps (dead API, no MCP client, hosting) is visible from the nemar-cli repo, and the
assistant that would consume it does not exist yet.

**How to apply:** Scope MCP or chatbot work as the new-assistant epic (tool use first), not as
maintenance on `src/assistants/nemar/`. Probe a host before repeating any hosting claim,
including this file's.
