# Incident: 53 published dataset repos deleted (nemarDatasets) — 2026-06


> **STATUS: HISTORICAL.** Incident record (2026-06). Retained as forensics; see ADR 0008.
> Current decisions live in [`.context/decisions/`](decisions/README.md); where this document and an ADR disagree, the ADR wins.

Tracked in nemarOrg/nemar-cli#883. Surfaced during the #869 HED backfill.

## What happened
53 **published** datasets (concept DOI + version manifests) had their **GitHub repos
deleted**, while their **D1 records and S3 data fully survive**. The 54th in the set,
`nm099999`, is the disposable E2E test dataset (ignore).

## Forensics (GitHub org Audit Log: action=repo.destroy)
- actor: **neuromechanist**, user_agent: **NEMAR-API** (the backend's own UA string),
  `programmatic_access_type`: classic PAT, **token_id `2058954005`** (scopes incl. `delete_repo`).
- `request_method: delete`, `request_category: api`, repos public.
- Timestamps: ~**03:00:1X UTC daily** (e.g. nm000346 @ 2026-06-26 03:00:15Z,
  nm000237 @ 2026-06-24 03:00:16Z), a few per day spread across the week — STILL ongoing.

## ROOT CAUSE (CONFIRMED 2026-07-01): zombie Workers on the retired personal CF account
- The **production** SCCN Worker is innocent: its `scheduled_cleanup` audit rows show
  `deleted:0, datasets:[]` every day (incl. every deletion date). hallu + mcm crontabs/
  launchd clean. No org GitHub Actions delete repos.
- The deleter was **two leftover NEMAR backend Workers on the retired *personal* Cloudflare
  account** (`Shirazi@ieee.org`, `10f166f3ec8395ff4a219f581c5f359d`): `nemar-api` +
  `nemar-api-dev`, serving legacy `api.osc.earth/nemar`. Never torn down after the SCCN
  migration (#314). Each had cron `0 3 * * *` (UTC → the `03:00:1X` fingerprint) and the old
  admin PAT (`2058954005`) as `GITHUB_ADMIN_PAT` (→ UA `NEMAR-API`; stopped on PAT rotation).
- Why prod data survived: their delete-cascade destroyed the **shared GitHub** repo (live PAT)
  while the S3 + D1 cascade steps hit the **dead personal account** → prod S3+D1 untouched.
- Ruled out as the exact selector: neither personal D1 still contains nm000192-346 and both
  compute stale-count 0 post-hoc, so the precise per-id selection query couldn't be
  reconstructed after teardown. Immaterial — the deployment is gone.

## RESOLUTION (2026-07-01)
- Removed crons, then deleted all 4 `nemar-*` Workers + both nemar D1s (`nemar-db`,
  `nemar-db-dev`) + both Vectorize indexes from the personal account. `osa-worker`,
  hed-bot/hedit, `wg-mesh`, `printlab`, and the 3 non-nemar R2 buckets left intact.
  Verified `api.osc.earth/nemar/*` → 404, `/osa/` → 200.
- Hardening: 53 repos restored; org `members_can_delete_repositories=false`,
  `default_repository_permission=read`. Documented on #314 (retirement epic) + #883.
- Secret hygiene follow-up: rotate any secret shared with prod that lived on the personal
  account (GitHub PAT already done); track under #885 (Infisical).

## Data safety
All 53 verified RECOVERABLE: each has intact `s3://nemar/<id>/version/*.json` (full
file→annex-key manifest), `objects/`, `archives/v*.zip` (complete snapshot), and `zarr/`.

## Recovery (in order)
1. **STOP it first:** revoke PAT `token_id 2058954005` (GitHub → Developer settings).
   Otherwise restored repos are re-deleted at the next 03:00 UTC.
2. **Find the cron:** `ssh hallu "crontab -l"`, `ssh mcm "crontab -l"` — look for a daily
   `0 3 * * *` (or `0 20` PT) script doing `gh repo delete` / these MOABB ids.
3. **Restore the repos** (GitHub deleted-repo restore is UI-only — no API): Org → Settings
   → Deleted repositories → Restore each (90-day window open; preserves git history).
   Fallback for any past-window: reconstruct from `archives/v*.zip` (complete snapshot).
4. Then reset NULL HED rows + re-run `nemar admin hed-sweep` so they classify.
