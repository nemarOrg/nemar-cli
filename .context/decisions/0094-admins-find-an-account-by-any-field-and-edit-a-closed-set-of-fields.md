# ADR 0094: Admins find an account by any field and edit a closed set of fields

**Status:** proposed
**Date:** 2026-10-09
**Owner:** Seyed Yahya Shirazi

## Context

`nemar admin users` listed accounts and filtered them by status, role, kind and tier.
Finding one person by anything else (a surname, an affiliation, half an ORCID iD, a date)
meant listing everyone and reading. Reading one account in full was
`GET /admin/users/:username`, which cannot reach a web or ORCID account (their username is
NULL by design, #1012) and selected every column of the table, so any admin received
`password_hash`, `verification_token` and the two encrypted AWS columns.
Changing a person's name, affiliation, location, username, email or GitHub handle had no
admin path at all (role, kind, status and upload access each have their own).

Two constraints shape any fix. Cloudflare D1 allows 100 bound parameters per statement, and a
bare `?` per column per word reaches that limit at four search words and passes it at five.
And an edit that touches who can act as an account is an account-takeover route: sign-in is
passwordless, so whoever holds an account's email can sign in as it, and a GitHub handle
receives repository access.

## Decision

**Search covers every text field, and "every" stays true by construction.**
`GET /admin/users?q=` splits the text into words (at most 8, each at most 100 characters)
and requires every word to be found, in any field, in any order. Matching is a case-insensitive
substring (ASCII, like SQLite `LIKE`), with a purely numeric word also matching the account id
exactly. The searchable columns are concatenated into one string and a word is bound once as a
numbered parameter and reused, so a search costs one parameter per word. Each row reports
`matched_in`, the columns that matched. An empty, over-long or over-wide query is a 400, never
a listing of everyone.

**Results are ranked, and an exact hit is named.** Each row carries `match_kind`, best first:
`exact` (the text IS the account's id, username, email, GitHub handle or ORCID iD, in the
spellings people paste: `@name`, an ORCID URL, any case), `name` (every word is a whole word of
the name or username), `prefix` (every word begins a word of the name, username, email or
handle), `substring`; newest first among equals. The server decides what "exact" means,
through the same normalisers that store an email, a handle or an ORCID iD (ADR 0043), and looks
identifiers up directly, because a pasted `@name` is not a substring of anything stored. The
CLI goes straight to a single exact hit and lists the other matches beneath it.

**When nothing matches, close matches are offered.** A second pass over the same filters
scores the username, email, GitHub handle, names, affiliation, city and country by edit
distance (one swap or slip per word of 4 to 6 characters, two from 7; none for 3 or fewer)
with accents and case folded, so `lovelase` finds Lovelace and `ekstrom` finds Ekström. It
runs only on a miss, returns at most 20 accounts, closest first, marked `match_kind: "fuzzy"`,
and the CLI labels them as near misses. Dates, status, role, the ORCID iD and the description
are never fuzzy-matched; a test pins the exact list.

**One classification of every `users` column decides what is searched and what is returned.**
`USER_COLUMN_ROLES` (`backend/src/services/user-search.ts`) labels each column `id`, `text`,
`flag`, `ref`, `secret` or `omit`. The search, the detail `SELECT` and the close-match columns
are derived from or checked against it. Credentials are `secret`: never searched (a hash would
become recoverable from match counts) and never returned. A test compares the table's keys with
`PRAGMA table_info(users)` in both directions, so a migration that adds a column fails until
someone decides what it is.

**`GET /admin/users/by-id/:id`** returns one account's non-secret columns, an explicit list,
plus dataset count, live key count and linked sign-in providers. By id because web accounts
have no username. The internal system account (id -1) can be read, and is refused by name for
edits.

**`PATCH /admin/users/by-id/:id` edits a closed set of fields, in two tiers.**
Any admin: `given_name`, `family_name`, `affiliation`, `city`, `country`.
Owners only: `username`, `email`, `github_username`, the three that decide who can act as the
account. Even for an owner they are refused on the owner's own account (that skips the proof
ADR 0044 asks for) and on any other owner's account (so one owner cannot hand themselves
another's sign-in). Values go through the self-service normalisers (`normalizeProfilePatch`
for everything but the email, `emailFieldSchema` for it), so an admin cannot store what the
person could not have typed. One thing differs on purpose: there is no username lock.
`PATCH /auth/profile` refuses an approved account's rename and tells the person to contact an
admin; this is that admin. Everything else is refused with a sentence saying where that change
IS made: role, status and upload access (their own commands, ADR 0040), account kind
(ADR 0048), the ORCID iD (proven by signing in, never typed, ADR 0043), the identity-conflict
flag, the person's own `description`, and credentials.

Rules the edit enforces. The guards apply to the fields that would actually change, so
re-sending current values is a 200 that writes nothing. Names are refused on an account with a
verified ORCID iD (ORCID would overwrite them at the next sign-in, ADR 0041). An address or
handle another live account holds is refused naming the holder (ADR 0043), with the database
constraint as the last word. A new email address resets `email_verified`, voids any
verification link already sent (so a typo'd pending account cannot be promoted with the link
mailed to the wrong inbox), and sends the PREVIOUS address the account-email-changed notice
that self-service sends, reporting whether it was sent. A changed username clears
`username_auto_assigned`. The change and its audit row are one batch, and the audit row is
written only if the update changed a row.

**CLI.** `nemar admin users --search`, `users show <query>`, `users edit <query> --flag ...`.
A query that is exactly one account's id, username, email, GitHub handle or ORCID iD picks it
even when longer names contain the text; `edit -y` is refused unless the account was named
exactly. Every failure of a search, `show` or `edit` exits non-zero, including a near-miss
`show`, an edit that could not ask for confirmation, and a backend that predates search (which
would otherwise print every account as a result). `show` and `edit` refuse the listing's own
filter flags that Commander would silently drop. Removing an affiliation or GitHub handle takes
`--clear-affiliation` or `--clear-github`; a flag with an empty value is refused, so an unset
shell variable cannot wipe a field. Everything a user typed is stripped of terminal escape
sequences before it is printed.

## Consequences

- A search scans the table, and a miss reads every account's name fields a second time to
  score them in code (SQLite has no edit distance). At about 600 accounts that is nothing;
  revisit both before the table is two orders of magnitude larger.
- The substring search folds ASCII case only: `ekström` finds `Ekström`, `EKSTRÖM` does not.
  The close-match pass folds accents, so on a miss `EKSTRÖM` is still found, labelled a near miss.
- Close matching is edit distance, not a search engine: it does not know that Bob is Robert,
  and it never stretches a word of three letters or fewer.
- Flags (`email_verified`, `service_access`, ...) are not searchable, because the word `1`
  would match every account. The existing filters are how a flag is asked for.
- The GitHub handle is checked for format and uniqueness, NOT against GitHub, because that
  check is a live network call the no-mocks test policy cannot exercise. Changing it does not
  revisit repository access already granted to the old handle.
- An admin who is not an owner cannot fix a mistyped email, username or handle. They ask an
  owner, or the person fixes it in Settings. An owner's own are changed in Settings.
- `GET /admin/users/:username` now selects every column that is not a secret
  (`ADMIN_USER_NON_SECRET_SELECT`: the detail list plus the notification preferences it has
  always returned), so a caller reading a non-secret column keeps working. A source scan
  (`backend/test/users-table-no-whole-row-read.test.ts`) fails on any query that reads a whole
  row of `users`, however it is spelled, so the pattern cannot return unnoticed.
- How the credentials are stored (hashed, keyed-hashed, encrypted, or plaintext) is a separate
  question this ADR does not decide; it only keeps them from being read out.
- **Residual risk, and a precedent that does not hold.** An earlier draft of this ADR said the
  owner-only line was "the same one key minting draws". It is not the same line: owner key
  minting REFUSES `person` accounts (`routes/admin/user-keys.ts`, ADR 0048), because a person
  gets credentials by signing in themselves. Changing a person's email gives an owner that
  capability by another door, since passwordless sign-in then reaches the account. The route
  narrows it (owner only; never one's own or another owner's account; the old address is told;
  the audit row records old and new values) but does not close it: an owner can still redirect
  a person account's sign-in, and the old holder's existing sessions and API keys stay valid.
  Whether to refuse email edits on `person` accounts outright, or to require proof from the
  new address, is a policy call left open for the maintainer.

## Alternatives considered

- **A `LIKE` per column with a bare `?` each.** The obvious query, and it reaches D1's
  100-parameter limit at four words. One expression over a concatenated string, with each word
  bound once and reused, avoids it and also avoids escaping `%` and `_`.
- **An FTS5 table or a trigram index for fuzzy search.** A second copy of personal data to
  keep in sync and back up, for a table this small. ADR 0034's reasoning (derive, do not
  store) cuts the same way.
- **Always blending close matches into the results.** A real hit buried among guesses is worse
  than an empty page, and "no exact matches" is information. They appear only on a miss.
- **Filtering the full listing in the CLI.** The listing omits most fields, and every search
  would ship every account to the terminal.
- **Letting any admin edit identity fields.** Changing an email is a sign-in takeover for
  whoever holds the new inbox.
- **Editing role, status or upload access here.** Each has a route that carries side effects
  (token and docs-session revocation, ADR 0040's single writer) this one would skip.
- **Fixing `handleCommandError` to set an exit code.** It is shared by most admin commands and
  would change all of them; the new commands set the code themselves.
