# ADR 0104: A withdrawn publication request is a denied one with `withdrawn_at`

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-10-14
**Owner:** Seyed Yahya Shirazi

## Context

A depositor could not take a publication request back; only an administrator could end it.
`publication_requests.status` is guarded by a CHECK constraint (`requested`, `approving`, `published`, `denied`, `blocked`), and several readers ask whether a request is finished with `status NOT IN ('published', 'denied')` or `status IN ('requested', 'approving', 'blocked')`: the re-request path, the staleness cron, the dataset delete guard and the publication sweep.

## Decision

1. A withdrawal is stored as `status = 'denied'` with a nullable `withdrawn_at` (migration 0097). `denied_by` and `denied_reason` stay NULL. The CHECK is not widened: that would rebuild a table of about thirty columns, and every reader above would have to learn a sixth status.
2. Anything that must tell the two endings apart reads `withdrawn_at` together with `status = 'denied'`. The status route reports `withdrawn` only for a denied row. This is a guard, not a revival path: a later `publish request` matches only active statuses and inserts a NEW row, so a withdrawn row stays withdrawn and no current writer sets `withdrawn_at` on a live row. The status term keeps a future writer that did revive a row from being read as a withdrawal.
3. The owner withdraws with `POST /datasets/:id/publish/withdraw`, one conditional UPDATE. It is allowed only while nothing has started acting on the request, and that is three conditions on the row: the status is `requested` or `blocked`, no approval is in flight, and publishing has not started. Publishing has started when `steps_completed` holds a step outside the validation-only ones (`hasStartedPublishing`) or `current_step` names one (a run cut off inside its first public step has recorded nothing yet and may still have changed the data). A request keeps its steps when a run is walked back to `blocked` or `requested`, so the status alone does not say whether the data is public. The answer to any of the three is 409 `withdraw_too_late`. The UPDATE carries all three conditions again, and an `updated_at` guard against a lost race, so a withdrawal and an approval or a denial that race cannot both succeed, and the loser sends nothing (what each loser is told, and what the withdrawal clears, is in the 2026-10-15 amendment below). The other writers that end or start a request are guarded the same way (the administrator's deny, the orchestrator's mark-approving write).
4. A writer that ends a request must guard on the request still being active and check the number of rows changed.
5. A withdrawal writes one `audit_log` row in the same batch as the status write: `publication_request_withdrawn`, resource type `dataset`, the dataset id as the resource, the owner as the user, and the request id in the details. The row is written only if the UPDATE changed a row, so a refused or lost withdrawal leaves none.
6. Only the dataset owner may withdraw, although an administrator may file a publication request on someone else's dataset. This is deliberate and unchanged: the withdrawal is the depositor taking back their own act, and an administrator ends a request with `deny`, which records who and why. The route answers 403 and says so, and so does the CLI help.

## Consequences

- A withdrawal is invisible to every reader that only knows `denied`; the administrator's list and the depositor's status say "withdrawn" from `withdrawn_at`.
- Administrators are not mailed on a withdrawal. A request simply leaves the active list. The audit row is the record.
- The dataset's staleness clock treats a withdrawn request like a denied one: there is no pending request.
- A request that has started publishing cannot be withdrawn by its owner at any status; an administrator decides what happens to it.
- A future writer of `status` on this table must keep the guard in 4.

## Amendment 2026-10-15 (#1726): what the integrated epic found in decision 3

Three reviews of the epic branch read decision 3 against the built routes.
Decision 3's sentence about the loser was written before the deny route and the approval route had their own refusals,
and the withdrawal's write grew a clause.
The text above was corrected in place only where it named the loser; this amendment states what is true now.
Where the two differ, this is the later text.

1. **The loser of a race with a withdrawal is told by its own route, and the word is not always 409.**
   - A withdrawal that loses (an approval is in flight, publishing has started, or another writer moved the request) is 409 `withdraw_too_late`, as decision 3 says.
   - An approval that loses to a withdrawal is 409 `request_changed`, because its conditional mark finds a request that is no longer active.
     The sentence of that refusal names a withdrawal beside a denial and a block (`REQUEST_CHANGED_MESSAGE`); it used to say only "denied or blocked", which read as a fault of the administrators' own making.
   - A denial that loses to a withdrawal is 404 `No active publication request found`, not 409.
     The deny route reads the request again after a lost write and answers by what it finds, and a withdrawn request is a denied one that is no longer active (decision 1), so the answer is the one for no active request.
     No denier and no reason are recorded on a withdrawn row, and a test holds that.
2. **A withdrawal clears a lapsed claim.**
   The withdrawal's UPDATE sets `APPROVAL_CLAIM_CLEAR_SQL`, as every statement that ends a request does.
   Decision 3 allows a withdrawal only when no approval is in flight, but a claim whose lease has lapsed is still on the row, and it would otherwise stay on a request that has ended.
   A token that verified for that claim then fails on the next call (ADR 0105, decision 1: clearing the claim is the revocation).
3. **The two statements of "publishing has started" are held together by a test.**
   Decision 3 states the rule once as `publishingHasStarted` and once as terms of the UPDATE (`NO_PUBLISHING_STARTED_SQL`).
   They agree on every well-formed row.
   On a `steps_completed` that is valid JSON but not an array of strings (an object, a scalar, a nested element), the SQL counts the request as started and the function does not, so the statement only ever refuses where the function would allow.
   JSON `null` and a `null` element are the exception: `json_each` yields NULL for them and `NULL NOT IN (...)` is not true, so neither says started.
   It is not aligned the other way, because `hasStartedPublishing` also decides which gates a resumed run may skip, and counting an unreadable row as started there would widen an exemption.
