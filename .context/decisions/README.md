# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant decisions that shape the project: choice of stack, structural patterns, trade-offs accepted, alternatives rejected. Tuck them all in here so they are easy to find later.

## Convention

- One file per decision: `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md`, zero-padded to four digits.
- `0000-template.md` is the template; copy it to start a new ADR. Do not edit `0000-template.md` itself.
- Number sequentially. The next ADR after `0007-...` is `0008-...`.
- Status flows `proposed` -> `accepted` -> (later) `superseded by ADR-NNNN`. Never delete an ADR; supersede it.
- An `Amendment YYYY-MM-DD:` block inside an accepted ADR is for a CLARIFICATION that leaves the
  verdict standing -- naming a mechanism the decision always implied, correcting a stale file path,
  recording what the decision turned out to cost. Anything that changes what was decided is a new
  ADR that supersedes this one, not an amendment: an amended verdict is invisible to anyone who
  read the ADR before, and the whole point of the `Status` line is that the verdict is findable.
- Keep each ADR short. If it grows past two screens, you are probably writing a design doc, not a decision.

## When to write an ADR

Write one when a decision:
- Will be hard or expensive to reverse.
- Cuts off other reasonable paths a future contributor might wonder about.
- Has been argued about more than once.
- Embeds a constraint (legal, performance, schedule) that is not obvious from the code.

Do not write one for routine choices that are obvious from reading the code.

## Index

Add new entries here as you create ADRs. **This list is enforced, not decorative:**
`test/adr-index.unit.test.ts` fails the build if an ADR on disk is missing from it, if an entry
points at a file that no longer exists, if the numbering has a gap or duplicate, or if an ADR
carries a `Status` outside `proposed | accepted | superseded by ADR-NNNN`. A superseded ADR must
name a target that exists.

The index is the entry point AGENTS.md tells readers to start from, so an unlisted ADR is an
invisible one — which is why it is checked rather than trusted.

- [ADR 0061](0061-a-registration-is-read-back-and-an-incomplete-dataset-is-not-partly-repaired.md) - A registration is read back from the location log, and a dataset the bucket cannot account for is never partly repaired
- [ADR 0062](0062-a-missing-git-annex-degrades-to-a-snapshot.md) - A missing git-annex degrades to an HTTP snapshot, and a snapshot is not a repository
- [ADR 0063](0063-recovered-content-is-pinned-or-proven-and-never-trusted-for-its-provenance.md) - Recovered content is pinned or proven, and an unproven copy is deleted rather than kept
- [ADR 0064](0064-a-dataset-missing-more-than-a-tenth-of-its-data-is-withdrawn.md) - NEMAR lists a dataset only when at least 90% of its DATA KEYS are available, and metadata never counts toward that (partially supersedes 0005)
- [ADR 0065](0065-anonymity-is-available-before-first-publication-and-never-after.md) - Anonymity is available before first publication and never after, and it is withheld by the writer
- [ADR 0066](0066-the-data-plane-brokers-git-tracked-files-under-manifest-capability.md) - The data plane brokers git-tracked files, and the manifest is the capability list

- [ADR 0075](0075-standards-papers-are-never-a-data-paper.md) - Standards, software, platform, and umbrella papers are never a dataset's data paper; relation types are chosen from resolved DOIs
- [ADR 0076](0076-news-images-live-in-their-own-r2-bucket.md) - News images live in their own R2 bucket and are served by the Worker; dataset bytes stay in S3
- [ADR 0077](0077-data-papers-in-metadata-json.md) - `metadata.json` serves `data_papers`, the citations judge's verdict, pulled from the dashboard into one D1 column
- [ADR 0078](0078-the-api-exposes-a-service-binding-entrypoint.md) - The API exposes the `NemarApiRpc` service-binding entrypoint; no method acts without the user's credential or a one-time grant, and the Cloudflare account is the trust boundary
- [ADR 0079](0079-the-private-site-holds-a-session-scope-of-its-own.md) - The private site holds a `private` session scope of its own, minted for any active account through a grant bound to the browser's `state`, ended by sign-out, revoke and delete but not by demotion or key revocation
- [ADR 0080](0080-a-web-approval-is-dispatched-to-an-executor.md) - A web approval is dispatched to an executor and never run by the page or the Worker: `/approve` stays the contract, a 15-minute lease allows one run at a time (a terminal run included), the payload names an environment and never a URL or credential, and the approver is the admin who clicked
- [ADR 0081](0081-nemar-emits-neurobagel-artifacts-by-one-pure-transform.md) - NEMAR emits Neurobagel artifacts by one pure transform over data-plane documents: identity only from `metadata.json`, `anonymous` must be exactly `false`, identifiers are uuid5 under one committed namespace, the vocabulary is a pinned snapshot, and a fact the rules cannot establish is left out and counted
- [ADR 0082](0082-the-neurobagel-node-runs-stock-on-nemaring-under-hard-limits-and-is-fed-by-pull.md) - The Neurobagel node runs stock on nemaring under hard resource limits, as one compose project over a pinned recipes release, and is fed by pull; reload is a measured, locked, verified, reversible operation
- [ADR 0083](0083-curated-neurobagel-annotations-are-a-reviewed-content-pinned-file.md) - Curated Neurobagel annotations are a reviewed, content-pinned file keyed by dataset id: terms only from the pinned vocabulary, a strict loader that fails closed and returns an entry the transform trusts only if the loader made it, git blob pins computed from the bytes converted, an entry that does not apply is skipped whole and the variables it names are withheld with a flag, a load failure stops conversion, and never generated at build time
- [ADR 0084](0084-federation-eligibility-is-one-predicate-decided-from-the-row-and-re-checked-at-read-time.md) - Federation eligibility is one predicate (SQL and TypeScript from one list of named terms) decided from the D1 row and re-checked at every read, with `anonymous: false` in the gathered metadata as a second independent guard whose disagreement is an audit-log finding only; `on` mirrors are included; a dataset that stops being eligible leaves the index before its artifacts are deleted; the writer is a hook that never fails, blocks or delays a flow, off unless `NEUROBAGEL_WRITER_ENABLED` is `1`, with a production-only bounded reconcile behind it; and the read token is a deployment secret, not an account credential
- [ADR 0085](0085-a-privacy-correction-scrubs-every-version-in-place.md) - A privacy correction scrubs every version in place, NEMAR keeps the history of each correction, and the scrub is a step in the import and publication workflows
- [ADR 0086](0086-publication-requests-are-screened-for-identifiers-in-ci-and-the-admin-mail-waits-for-the-verdict.md) - A publication request starts an identifier screen in `nemarDatasets/.github` and the admin mail waits for its verdict: the report is a closed vocabulary parsed at the door, a screen that did not run or report is mailed as such and never read as clear, a direct identifier blocks with no override, lesser findings need a recorded admin reason, the gate is bound to the screened commit, and the check is best effort and says what it did not read
- [ADR 0087](0087-the-upload-preflight-screens-locally-refuses-direct-identifiers-and-is-never-trusted.md) - `nemar dataset upload` screens the dataset on the uploader's machine before anything is sent, with the publication screen's scan and words: direct identifiers refuse with no override (also under `--dry-run`), a lesser verdict proceeds only on a prompt or a flag that names every condition found (`--yes` never counts, no free text), the tree is screened again right before the create call, and the verdict is recorded inside the deposit attestation, parsed at the door, served nowhere, and never trusted
- [ADR 0088](0088-published-datasets-are-re-screened-on-a-verdict-free-cycle-and-the-weekly-report-says-what-was-not.md) - Published datasets are re-screened by the same workflow on a production-only, 30-minute tick, a few at a time, on a cadence that never depends on the verdict (the run list is public); a verdict counts for 28 days and only for the version it was dispatched for, a failure moves the attempt and never the verdict, and a weekly admin email under its own category says what was screened, what was not and why, and which datasets carry findings, sent once by an atomic claim that fails closed
- [ADR 0089](0089-an-import-scrubs-before-it-copies-and-waits-for-the-identifier-screen.md) - An OpenNeuro import scrubs the cloned tree in prepare with ADR 0085's rules before anything is copied (flagged headers downloaded, patched, annexed as SHA256E, uploaded, old keys retired; identifier JSON values blanked; images and documents held for the screen), refuses before the push what it cannot read, verify or move, cuts the copy manifest to the committed tree minus dead keys so a re-import cannot copy back a replaced key, and finalize waits for the identifier screen and approves only a clear verdict; a held publication is not a failed import, and a forward fix of git-tracked content is never approved automatically
- [ADR 0090](0090-acquisition-dates-finer-than-year-and-month-are-warned-about-never-gated-or-rewritten.md) - Policy B for acquisition dates (maintainer, 2026-10-07): a date finer than year and month stays a review-level finding that never gates and that nothing rewrites, and a fixed warning from one definition (`dateWarningLines`, a count and fixed words, never a value) is shown wherever the screen's counts are: the upload preflight, the publication status and the blocked-request mail, and the admin publication mail and list; no verdict or acknowledgment changes, and policy A (coarsen to year and month) would be a new ADR; an accepted publication request is told one neutral notice (`publicationRequestNotice`) that names no finding, verdict or date warning (amendment 2026-10-07)
- [ADR 0091](0091-a-new-recordings-acquisition-dates-are-set-to-1-january-and-nothing-published-is-changed.md) - New data has its acquisition dates set to 1 January of their year (maintainer, 2026-10-07): one shared rule, `normalizeEdfDates`, separate from ADR 0085's scrub, sets the EDF/BDF header start date and the EDF+ `Startdate` slot (`dd-MMM-yyyy`) by the scanner's own reading, all or nothing per header, keeping the year, the time and every other byte, proven by `verifyDateNormalization`; a first import applies it through the scrub's key replacement and sets inline `_scans.tsv` `acq_time` values, and a date by itself never refuses (a date-only recording it cannot fetch or prove keeps its date); `nemar dataset upload` plans before the preflight and sets headers after the final confirmation by copy and rename, leaving files git tracks, ignores or holds in a nested repository, links, unwritable or changed files, and every table; ADR 0090's warning covers only what remains, and nothing already published is changed
- [ADR 0092](0092-dataset-pull-requests-get-a-derived-verdict-from-a-worker-gated-model-review.md) - A pull request to a dataset is reviewed by Haiku 5.5 (high effort) through a Worker gate (proposed, maintainer, 2026-10-08): the Worker receives the App's `pull_request` delivery, forks included, dedupes per commit, applies the contributor tally (paused after more than 5 rejected pull requests AND more than 10 percent of their decided ones, a maintainer override wins) and the rate caps, and dispatches one central workflow in `nemarDatasets/.github` that reads the change as git data with no checkout and holds the only federated Anthropic identity; the verdict is derived from the report and git facts, never read from the model, every change is accounted for in exact counts, and the result is a success, failure or `action_required` check plus one edited-in-place comment, with the check not yet required by any ruleset
- [ADR 0093](0093-admins-find-an-account-by-any-field-and-edit-a-closed-set-of-fields.md) - Admins find an account by any field and edit a closed set of fields (proposed, maintainer, 2026-10-09): `GET /admin/users?q=` needs every word in any text field, ranks hits (exact identifier, name, prefix, substring) with the exact-hit rule on the server, and offers up to 20 typo and accent near misses only when nothing matches; one column classification (`USER_COLUMN_ROLES`) keeps credentials out of search and detail, and the older username-keyed detail route now selects only non-secret columns; `PATCH /admin/users/by-id/:id` lets any admin edit name, affiliation and location and only an owner edit username, email or GitHub handle (never an owner's account), voids stale verification links and notifies the old address, with the sign-in takeover risk that remains recorded as open

## Backfill note (2026-07-31)

ADRs 0001-0021 were written retroactively from decisions that had accumulated across
`.context/` design docs, plans, and research notes. Where a decision now lives in an ADR,
the originating document keeps its analysis and points here rather than restating the
choice, so there is exactly one place that says what was decided.

The originals remain the record of *how* a decision was reached; the ADR is the record of
*what* was decided and why. Dates on backfilled ADRs are the original decision dates where
known, not the date they were written down.
