# Portable compute: workstation runners, one container, Zarr in and out

**Status:** revision 2, 2026-11-13 (Friday), after three pack reviews; dispositions in `dispositions.md`.
**Owner:** Seyed Yahya Shirazi.
**Demo:** an NIH brain meeting on Sunday 2026-11-15; the demo freeze is 2026-11-15T06:00 Pacific.
**Repositories:** `nemarOrg/nemar-cli` (control plane, contracts, reader core), `nemarOrg/nemar-process` (launcher, runner, images, recipes), `sccn/eegprep` (numerics and the Python reader), `nemarOrg/docs` (pages, later).

Abbreviations, defined once here: Architecture Decision Record (ADR); command-line interface (CLI); continuous integration (CI); Open Container Initiative (OCI); OCI Registry As Storage (ORAS); Singularity Image Format (SIF); GitHub Container Registry (GHCR); Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS); electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG); intracranial EEG (iEEG); tab-separated values (TSV); content delivery network (CDN); digital object identifier (DOI); OpenID Connect (OIDC); graphics processing unit (GPU); Structured Query Language (SQL); Transmission Control Protocol (TCP); universally unique identifier (UUID); the NSF program Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS); Cloudflare's SQLite database (D1); Cloudflare's object store (R2); Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM); service unit (SU); quality control (QC); high-performance computing (HPC); Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This repository is public.
Workstations are "workstation A" and "workstation B" everywhere in this pack; host names, accounts, ssh aliases, paths and network details live only in the gated docs (`admin/operations/systems-inventory`) and in the operator's private notes, and the manager supplies the aliases at dispatch from the owner's answer.
"The demo workstation" is the one DM-01's rule picks: the machine that does not run the production Zarr conversion cron, unless only that one can run a container (risk K16).

Owner decisions of 2026-11-13 are folded in: Q3 option A (signed CI image after the owner merges to `main`), the serving-copy QC label, Q9 (public data only on runners), and a read-only probe over the existing aliases as the owner's login; creating a directory or installing anything on a workstation still waits on Q12.
The reader work in a collaborator's fork is called "the collaborator's reader epic".

## 0. How the manager uses this plan

1. **Start prompt** (the host's self-paced loop with no interval; `/loop ` prefix in Claude Code):

   ```text
   You are the manager of NEMAR portable compute, demo track then full program.
   Run one tick of the runbook at <absolute path to .context/plans/portable-compute/runbook.md in the board worktree>, exactly as written, using the project:manager-loop skill.
   The state is the board beside it: <absolute path to board.md>.
   Your manager id is <host>-claude-sonnet, the same on every tick.
   Do not write product code.
   Do not change the plan, a card, a gate, the parity, or a budget limit.
   When the runbook says to stop or to ask, or does not cover what you see, record it on the board, ask the owner with a structured question, and stop that thread of work.
   ```

   Pacing: 20 minutes while any card is `active` before the freeze; afterwards 30 minutes with workers running and 60 waiting on people.
2. **The tick** is `runbook.md`; its Setup section creates the board, the epic branches, and the commit that puts this pack on them.
3. **Precedence.** The owner's later instructions override this plan and are logged with `decide`.
   `AGENTS.md` overrides this plan except for two explicit exceptions, and **approving this plan is the owner's knowing override of `AGENTS.md` on both**:
   (a) `AGENTS.md` says "never hand-roll an epic" and names `/project:epic-dev`; this program is driven by `project:manager-loop` instead, with the board replacing `.claude/epic.local.md` and the manager mirroring each step into its epic issue;
   (b) the demo's control plane runs as a local stack, so nothing in the demo track merges into `dev`.
   Where an ADR and this plan disagree, the ADR wins; this plan proposes ADRs and never edits an accepted one except by a dated pointer amendment or a superseding ADR.
   Approving the plan also approves the one `AGENTS.md` edit it makes (DM-05 adds `COMPUTE_RUNNERS_ENABLED` to the dark-switch hard rule).
4. **Merge authority.** The manager merges, after the merge gate, phase PRs into the two epic branches only: nemar-cli `feature/portable-compute-epic` and nemar-process `feature/runner-epic`, with `gh pr merge <n> --squash --admin`.
   It never merges an epic into `dev` or `main`, anything in `sccn/eegprep` or `nemarOrg/docs`, a release, or anything that publishes; those are the owner's, handed over as exact commands.
5. **Question classes that may take a default at their deadline:** none, unless the owner pre-authorizes one in `open-questions.md` (Q2 and Q4 offer that).
6. **Routing.** Implementers are Sonnet (`worker`, `worker-hard`); reviews are the Sonnet panel of `project:pr-review-toolkit` plus ONE Opus review on every card whose Review line says so.
   Opus is the lead and the default advisor.
   The frontier tier (Fable) is used at checkpoint CP-F (end of the demo track), and on the **frontier trigger**: the lead tier cannot decide a contested architecture finding after one Opus advisor consult, or the same card loops through three failed approaches.
7. **Live facts** added to every dispatch: `$WT` (worktree root), `$NEMAR_CLI`, `$NEMAR_PROCESS`, `$EEGPREP` (primary checkouts, never edited), base heads, open PRs, and the DM-01 and DM-02 findings in public-safe form.

## 1. Goal, scope and the honest verdict

Processing starts on lab workstations with proper queues, and the same containerized job later runs on HPC.
The design already made stays: ADR 0118's gateway, ledger, records, the two digests, `nemar.launch-spec.v1`, the `nemar-launch` launcher, the observer, recipes with signalJourney, and the owner's dark switches.
This plan EXPANDS it: a workstation runner becomes an executor beside Tapis, Zarr conversion becomes a pipeline in nemar-process, and one format with one conformance suite and one credentialed engine serves every reader.

**Honest verdict on the demo.** The control-plane chain DM-04 -> DM-05 -> DM-06 -> DM-07 -> DM-17 -> DM-18 is about 34 hours of implementation, review and merge from Friday 15:00, so a live end-to-end run (G5) before CP-GO (Saturday 18:00) is unlikely.
**The plan of record for Sunday is fallback F2**: labeled components (the recipe container run by hand on the demo workstation on real public data, the reader in mne-python live, the recorded test runs, the architecture).
If the chain lands early enough for one recorded end-to-end run (F1) before 2026-11-15T05:00, the brief adds it, labeled with its time and commits.
Nothing is presented as live that did not run live.

## 2. Architecture (lead decisions)

Each decision: what, why in one line, and the rejected alternative.
ADR 0121 (DM-03) records D1 to D7 and D14's demo rule; ADR 0122 (DM-03) records D8; ADR 0123 (Z0) records D10 and D13; ADR 0124 (R0) records D9 and D11; D12 needs no ADR.

### 2.1 Executors and accounting

**D1. A job names its executor and its accounting class.**
`compute_jobs.executor` is `tapis` (default) or `runner`; a runner job also records `runner_backend` `local` (workstation) or `slurm` (slurm-direct, phase H).
`compute_jobs.accounting` is `su` (default) or `none`; a Tapis job is always `su` (a CHECK says so).
Executor mechanics (the advance tick, the submit claim, the cancel sweep, the tenant sweep, the admin advance, and #2121 P3's admitter when it lands) select `executor = 'tapis'`; money and tenancy (the ledger, `tenantGuard`, the pipelines' live cap, the observer's settlement, the ACCESS report) select `accounting = 'su'`.
*Why:* accounting follows the resource, not the dispatch mechanism, so a runner on an allocated cluster later is `su` without a rewrite.
*Rejected:* keying money on the executor (a runner on an allocation would escape the ledger), and a table per executor (forks records and reports).

**D2. No new state; a waiting runner job is `created` with `runner_claimed_at` NULL.**
A claim sets `runner_claimed_at`, `runner_id` and a lease and leaves the state `created`; the runner's `started` heartbeat writes `created -> running`, its `uploading` heartbeat `running -> archiving`, and `finished` stands only after `verifyResults`.
An unstarted lease that expires clears the claim (no backward edge needed); a started job whose runner goes silent becomes `unreported`.
The column is deliberately not #2121 P3's `admitted_at`, so either migration can land first; S5 converges them.
For `runner/local`, `submitted` and `queued` are never used; whether a `runner/slurm` job uses `queued` for its time in a SLURM queue is decided at H1.
*Rejected:* a `claimed` state (widens every CHECK for what a column says).

**D3. Workstations pull; NEMAR never pushes.**
`nemar-runner` (nemar-process, Python 3.9 or newer, standard library only) runs as an unprivileged user, opens no port, sends `User-Agent: nemar-runner/<version>`, and polls the Worker over HTTPS.
*Rejected:* NEMAR ssh-ing jobs to hosts (a push surface and stored host credentials), and a message broker (a new service).

**D4. Protocol `nemar.runner.v1`: register, exchange, claim, heartbeat, complete.**

- *Register* (owner only) mints a secret `nmr_` plus 64 hex, shown once, stored as SHA-256, with capacity, `accounting`, `site` (a fixed word) and `trust` (`lab` or `hpc`).
- *Exchange:* the secret and the protocol version buy a 15-minute access token `nmra_` plus 64 hex, hashed at rest.
  `authMiddleware` and `resolveApiKeyUser` refuse both prefixes before any lookup (`runner_credential_not_accepted`), as ADR 0119 does for `nmo_`.
- *Claim:* returns `jobs` with up to `free_slots` entries, each admitted by its own conditional UPDATE (the `claimOpenDispatch` pattern), each with its own 10-minute lease; the dataset's public eligibility is checked again inside the statement; the claim writes `launch_spec_digest` of the launch specification it answers (a re-claim overwrites it from its own specification) and keeps `image_digest`.
- *Heartbeat* every 60 seconds renews the lease and answers `cancel`.
- *Complete* is idempotent for `(job, lease_id)`: the lease is kept after completion, so a retried complete answers the same state.
- *Lease rules:* a started job's lease is never replaced; an unstarted expired lease releases the claim (at most 3 claims, then `failed` `runner_lost` `claims_exhausted`); a started job past its lease is `unreported`, and an `unreported` runner job whose outputs completed is verified like any other, otherwise it fails `runner_lost` `lease_expired` after 60 minutes.
- *Deadline:* the runner sends SIGTERM at `NEMAR_JOB_END_TIME` plus 60 seconds and SIGKILL 30 seconds later; the Worker fails a started job past `started_at` plus its minutes plus 15 minutes with `runner_lost` `deadline_exceeded` unless its outputs completed.
  `sweepRunnerLeases` runs on every claim call (every environment, so the local stack and staging get it whenever a runner polls) and on the production 30-minute tick.
- *Acceptance:* bundle, outputs and outputs-complete calls of a runner job need the current lease (`X-Compute-Lease`); at least once execution, at most once acceptance.
*Rejected:* exactly-once execution (impossible across a partition), and a WebSocket push.

**D5. Runner credentials cascade, and a revoke ends the runner's work.**
Revoking a registration, in one batch: revokes it, deletes its tokens, releases its unstarted claims, and moves its started jobs to `unreported` with the lease cleared, so neither `job_token` nor lease can land outputs; they then follow D4.
`runnerEndStatements(userId)` does the same for every registration an owner made, in the batch of `finalizeRevocation`, `tombstoneUserCascade` and an owner's role demotion; `RUNNER_END_CALLERS` names them and a source-scan test holds the list; a key revocation is deliberately not a caller.

**D6. An `accounting = 'none'` job writes no ledger entry; usage is measured and labeled.**
No hold, charge or adjustment; the terminal batch stamps `settled_provisional_at` and `settled_final_at` with `charged_milli = 0`, so the records copy and the reports treat it as settled; usage is `runner_wall_seconds`, `runner_cpu_seconds` and `runner_max_rss_mb`, shown as "runner-reported core-hours", never as SU.
Capacity is the runner guard inside the job's INSERT: live `accounting = 'none'` runner jobs of the pool fewer than `policy.runners.maxLiveJobs[pool]` (default cpu 64, gpu 8).
`accounting = 'su'` runner jobs are refused (`runner_accounting_unbuilt`) until phase H builds hold, settlement and ACCESS for them.
A runner job's sizing uses an existing partition name as a label only (`shared`, whose ceilings apply), and `estimateSuMilli` is never called for it.
*Rejected:* a zero-SU hold (a shape that lies about a budget), and a second ledger in core-hours.

**D7. A third dark switch, `COMPUTE_RUNNERS_ENABLED`**, needed with `computeEnabled(env)`, absent from `wrangler-sccn.toml`, pinned by the flag test, and named in `AGENTS.md`'s dark-switch rule.

### 2.2 Containers

**D8. One OCI image, pinned by digest, runs under Apptainer (primary) or Docker or Podman (second backend).**
Apptainer is primary on workstations and HPC (rootless, no daemon, already exercised by the launcher's CI); Docker or Podman uses pinned isolation flags; a rootful `docker` group is allowed only on a single-tenant lab machine recorded in the gated inventory.
Resource limits: Docker gets `--cpus` and `--memory` always; Apptainer gets `--cpus` and `--memory` when the runner's `doctor` proved cgroup delegation (`NEMAR_ENFORCE_LIMITS=1`), and otherwise the runner's watchdog enforces wall time and resident memory.
Images are built once in CI and signed **only** from `main` or an `image-nemar-python-v*` tag (the workflow's `SIGNING_IDENTITY`).
Owner decision (Q3, option A): the owner merges nemar-process PR #17 and `feature/runner-epic` (once DM-13 is in it) into `main`, and CI publishes and signs the demo image; the manager never merges to `main`.
If no signed digest verifies by 2026-11-14T08:00, the fallback is an operator-built, unsigned image labeled with its source commit and image id, and after that F2 and F3.

### 2.3 Data and fidelity

**D9. Read what the job needs, keep it only for the job.**
Inputs land only in the job's own directory under the runner root (mode 0700), deleted in a `finally` and swept at runner start; private bytes never enter a shared cache.
The demo recipe streams whole recordings into memory with no dataset download and nothing kept on disk; launcher-staged Zarr inputs (launch specification v2, R3) make the platform, not the recipe, record what was read.

**D13. The Zarr serving copy is lossy, and every derived product names the fidelity it describes.**
The serving copy is int16 and resampled to modality caps (EEG and MEG 250 Hz, iEEG and electromyography 1000 Hz; ADR 0028 and the converter).
QC on it describes the serving copy, not the archived recordings, and the demo says so.
Owner decision (2026-11-13): everything runs on the Zarr serving copy by default (EEG 250 Hz; EMG and iEEG 1 kHz), and the demo carries the plain label above.
A named fidelity profile carried by the index (`serving` now, a native-rate lossless `native` later) stays an option for ADR 0123, not a demo item; every derived product already states `profile: serving`.

**D14. Derived outputs have their own home.**
A derivative is an addressable object keyed by (source dataset version, recipe, recipe version, engine, input profile, index digest), with its own retention class and optionally its own DOI.
It is never written into the raw-only serving copy (ADR 0027) and never committed into the dataset repository (a version bump, an irrevocable DOI and a stamp loop).
The demo keeps outputs in the local stack's R2 stand-in or the operator's scratch and says so; the durable store is step V1 (Q11).

### 2.4 Zarr conversion becomes a pipeline (phase Z)

**D10.** The converter, its tests, the biosigIO pin and the admission ledger move to nemar-process (`nemar-zarr` image, `nemar-zarr-convert` recipe); the gate, the serving schemas, `/zarr-ready`, CDN purge and the queue state stay in nemar-cli, the state becoming D1 pipeline stamps.
ADR 0123 supersedes ADR 0029 and, because the queue moves to D1 and admission moves to runners, also ADR 0033 and ADR 0101, restating their rules where they now live.
The biosigIO pin is mirrored today in `requirements.txt`, `hallu-zarr.sh` (spec, floor, cap), `generate_zarr.py`'s `SUBJECT_INFO_FLOOR` (the subject-info privacy floor, exit 78) and `test_hallu_zarr_config.py`; the drift test covers all of them and the privacy floor survives the move.
Raw input reaches a conversion runner through the data plane's presigned reads (no storage credential); serving writes go through a promote mechanism CP-F chooses against the scale (up to 25,000 stores per dataset, recordings of 100 to 145 GiB, the Worker's 1,000 subrequests per invocation).
Reproducibility contract: a store is reproduced by deterministic reconversion, and the index records the converter image digest and the conversion job id.
No outage: formats contract (Z1), shadow conversions compared with the cron's including the largest datasets (Z5), cutover per dataset (Z6), cron retired last.

### 2.5 Readers (phase R)

**D11. One format, one conformance suite, one credentialed engine.**
Guarantee: a public store is readable by stock zarr-python or xarray with no NEMAR code.
Three readers survive and are held to one conformance suite: the TypeScript core from the collaborator's reader epic (CLI, MCP, local engine), eegprep-lean (Python and Pyodide), and EEGDash's own reader (their team).
The engine's unique job is credential brokering for private data; eegprep-lean gains an engine transport for it.
Owner decision (Q9, 2026-11-13): runners process public data only; private data on runners waits for launcher-staged, no-network private jobs (R3, R4).
The demo does not claim a consolidated reader: it uses eegprep-lean at an unmerged commit, labeled.

### 2.6 Recipes

**D12. eegprep is the numerics; recipes annotate.**
`nemar-floor-zarr` is a transition name for nemar-floor's chain on a Zarr input; step Q0 converges it into one `nemar-floor` with the input kind as an argument, on both executors.
For Zarr-input recipes the stamp tuple must grow (Zarr engine version, converter image digest, biosigIO version, reader version, index digest): Q0 adds it; until then the recipe records them in signalJourney.
A Zarr-input recipe may open HTTPS connections to its `--zarr-base` origin and nowhere else; every other recipe still opens none.
A recording the QC skipped is a counted refusal in the outputs, never a silent hole; QC ships later as sample-aligned masks (Q2); derived products carry `GeneratedBy` and `SourceDatasets` with the version DOI and a citation string (V1).

### 2.7 What changes in ADR 0118's model

| Item | Change |
|---|---|
| `compute_jobs` | `executor`, `accounting`, `runner_backend`, `runner_id`, `runner_claimed_at`, `lease_id`, `lease_expires_at`, `claim_attempts`, `runner_remote_id`, `runner_wall_seconds`, `runner_cpu_seconds`, `runner_max_rss_mb` |
| New tables | `compute_runners`, `compute_runner_tokens` |
| Words | executors, backends, accounting classes, runner refusals, `runner_lost` with details `lease_expired`, `claims_exhausted`, `deadline_exceeded`, `runner_revoked` |
| Ledger | none for `accounting = 'none'` (D6); a dated pointer amendment to ADR 0118 names ADR 0121 against decision 3 and the A3 amendment's item 1 |
| Unchanged | states, transitions, digests, records, retention, verification, the Tapis lifecycle, ACCESS for `su` jobs |

A result is reproducible from (image digest, launch specification, input snapshot) with no runner and no Tapis; each job records its runner's registration facts (site, trust, capacity) as host facts.

### 2.8 Numbers

ADR 0120 is held for the collaborator's reader epic (DM-03 makes `test/adr-index.unit.test.ts` tolerate the gap); this program takes **0121 to 0124**; draft PR #1641 also takes "the next free number", so whichever lands second renumbers.
Migrations: `dev` is at 0130, #2116 holds 0131, 0132 and 0134, #2121 P3 plans 0136; this program takes **0140 to 0149** and adds no column P3 adds.

## 3. Demo track (Sunday 2026-11-15)

### 3.1 What can be said

Plan of record (F2): "NEMAR's QC recipe, built on eegprep, ran in a container identified by its image digest on a lab workstation over a real public EEG dataset, streaming the recordings from NEMAR's Zarr serving copy with no dataset download and nothing kept on disk, and wrote QC tables with signalJourney provenance; the same recordings open in mne-python. QC ran on NEMAR's Zarr serving copy (EEG resampled to 250 Hz, 16-bit), not on the archived recordings. The pull-based runner and its queue are built and tested against NEMAR's real control-plane code; they are not yet deployed."
If DM-14 took path A, add "built and signed in CI"; under path B say "operator-built from source commit <sha>, unsigned".
If F1 exists, add: "A recorded run shows the runner on the lab workstation claiming the job from NEMAR's control plane, running locally and not deployed, and completing it."
Never say or imply: runs on HPC unchanged, the runner verified a signature, private data, EEGLAB support, EEGDash integration, derivatives published or citable, catalog-scale throughput, built in CI (unless path A happened), or a consolidated NEMAR reader.
Input provenance (`index_sha256`, `bytes_read`) is written by the recipe and not verified by the platform; G6 proves schema validity only.

### 3.2 Gates (pre-registered)

| Gate | Literal check | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| G1 probe | `probe-findings.md` from DM-01, and DM-14's step C1 | a demo workstation is named, and it runs the digest-pinned test container as the owner's login |
| G2 control plane | on the nemar-cli epic head: `bun test backend/test/compute-runner-registry.test.ts backend/test/compute-runner-end-callers.test.ts backend/test/compute-runner-jobs.test.ts backend/test/compute-runner-queue.test.ts backend/test/compute-local-stack-runner.test.ts test/admin-compute-runners-cli.test.ts`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run migrations:d1-check` | all pass |
| G3 runner | `uv run pytest tests/runner -q`, and the CI job of DM-18 running `tests/e2e/test_runner_stack.py` | pass; the CI job ran, not skipped |
| G4 image | path A (plan of record): `crane digest` equals the record's digest and `cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp '<the workflow's SIGNING_IDENTITY>'` passes; path B (fallback): the image id equals the record's digest and `LABEL.txt` names the source commit | as stated |
| G5 live run | `TEST_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 bun run src/index.ts admin compute jobs record <job> --json` | `finished`, `executor` `runner`, `runner_backend` `local`, `image_digest` as in G4, within 45 minutes of dispatch |
| G6 provenance | `uv run --group signaljourney python scripts/validate_signaljourney.py <file>` | exit 0 |
| G7 discard | on the demo workstation: `find "$RUNNER_ROOT/jobs" -mindepth 1 | wc -l` | `0`, and `scratch_discarded job=<job>` in the runner log |
| G8 reader | DM-19 step 5's one-liner | `nchan` and `sfreq` equal the index's values |
| F2-a | DM-19: the manual container run on the demo workstation exits 0, its signalJourney passes G6, its output directory is deleted and `test ! -e` confirms | all |
| F2-b | DM-19: G8 on the operator's machine | as G8 |
| F2-c | DM-19: the merged cards' G2 and G3 test runs, recorded | each recorded run passes |

### 3.3 Cut line (dropped first, in order)

1. The Docker backend (DM-10), unless DM-01's verdict for the demo workstation is `docker` or `podman`.
2. The second workstation.
3. The `ssh -R` path: the stack would run on the demo workstation's loopback, which needs Bun installed there (a separate owner decision); without it, F1 is dropped.
4. The signed CI image (Q3, decided A: the owner merges to `main` and CI signs): if no signed digest verifies by 2026-11-14T08:00, the operator-built unsigned image (path B), labeled with source commit and image id; if B is not on the workstation by 2026-11-14T12:00, F3.
5. The live run: F1 (recorded) if it exists by 2026-11-15T05:00, else F2 alone (the plan of record).

Never dropped: `AGENTS.md`'s hard rules, the no-mocks rule, a digest-identified image (except F3, labeled), signalJourney provenance, scratch discard, the labels, and the converter's lock, ledger and scratch left untouched.

### 3.4 Fallbacks

- **F2 (plan of record):** F2-a, F2-b, F2-c and the architecture slide; the manual run is labeled "manual run, not dispatched by NEMAR"; an unsigned image is labeled as such.
- **F1 (only if it exists):** the first G5 pass, recorded end to end and labeled with its time and commits.
- **F3 (if no container ran by 2026-11-14T12:00, or Q12 is not answered yes):** the recipe in a uv environment on the operator's own machine, labeled "on the operator's machine, outside a container".

### 3.5 Schedule (Pacific)

The control-plane chain is about 34 hours (DM-04 4 h, DM-05 6 h, DM-06 6 h, DM-07 8 h, DM-17 2 h, DM-18 2 h, plus review and merge on each), which is why F2 is the plan of record.

## 4. Full program (after the demo)

Outline steps are completed into cards at the checkpoint in the last column.
Hosts: `mgr` the manager's machine, `ws-a` and `ws-b` the workstations, `ci` GitHub Actions, `stg` staging, `prod` production.
Tiers: `w` worker, `wh` worker-hard, `lead`.

## 5. What I could not verify

1. Every workstation fact (DM-01 probes runtimes, user namespaces, cgroup delegation, SLURM, GPU, scratch, egress, TCP forwarding).
2. That the launcher runs under a runner with only the Tapis and SLURM variables replaced (read in nemar-process, not run).
3. Refuted by review and fixed: the image workflow publishes only from `main` or a tag (Q3).
4. That `zarr.nemar.org` serves eegprep-lean's and the runner's User-Agents (ADR 0049 recorded a 403 for `Python-urllib`).
5. That nemar-floor's steps accept a dictionary built from Zarr, and their memory on whole recordings.
6. Settled by review: eegprep's `origin/develop` is 0.5.0 and tag `v0.5.0` exists.
7. The collaborator's fork contents (read through the GitHub interface, not run).
8. The private tier's access mechanism (read, not run).
9. That the compute test harness runs long-lived outside `bun test` (DM-08 proves it or stops).
10. That D1 accepts the claim statement shape.
11. Confirmed by review: #2116's and P3's migrations add none of this program's columns.
12. Partly refuted by review: `JOB_INSERT_SQL` and `GATEWAY_USER_INSERT_SQL` are gated on the hold row, so DM-06 writes runner statements of its own.
13. Outbound HTTPS from HPC nodes, and whether a site allows a polling agent on a login node.
14. Confirmed by review: the signalJourney validator is a git dependency group with no command line; DM-13 writes the wrapper.
15. Whether an operator-built image's id passes the launcher and verification end to end as `image_digest` (DM-14 option B and DM-17 check it).
