# Compute program: roadmap and driver playbook

**Status:** current, 2026-11-03.
**Owner:** Seyed Yahya Shirazi.
**Driver:** a Haiku model at maximum effort runs development from this file; it orchestrates, it does not write code.

This is the entry point for the compute program: NEMAR's own processing pipelines and third-party jobs on SDSC Expanse through a NEMAR Tapis tenant, NEMAR as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for the partner site compute.nemar.org, allocation accounting, and per-job records.
The design is the gated docs page `admin/design/compute-gateway` in `nemarOrg/docs` (readable at `docs.nemar.org/admin/design/compute-gateway/` with an admin session, or with `nemar admin docs admin/design/compute-gateway`).
Where the patterns live in this codebase is in [`implementation-notes.md`](implementation-notes.md).
Each phase issue is the implementer's complete brief: goal, routing, scope, changes, tests, acceptance criteria, gates, rules, escalation triggers.

Where this file, an issue and an ADR disagree, the ADR wins, then the issue, then this file.
When implementation shows the plan was wrong, change the issue and the design page in the same pull request that changes the behaviour; plans are expected to move.

## 1. Roadmap

| Epic | Repository | Batch | Starts when |
|---|---|---|---|
| A. Compute gateway core: ledger, jobs, Tapis client, records, pipeline dispatch | nemar-cli | 1 | now |
| C. nemar-process: launcher, images, eegprep recipes with signalJourney, Tapis definitions | nemar-process | 1 | now |
| B. NEMAR sign-in: an OpenID Connect provider | nemar-cli, website, docs | 1 | now |
| D. Third-party compute: access, user API, `nemar compute`, the partner contract, policies | nemar-cli, docs | 2 | A and B merged to `dev` |
| E. Website compute surfaces | website | 2 | D's routes merged to `dev` |

The epic issues, their phase sub-issues and their dependencies are listed in section 6.
First party comes first: A and C together are what NEMAR's data-quality work waits for.
B runs beside them because the partner's integration takes calendar time.

**Reserved numbers**, so parallel epics never collide:
migrations 0114 to 0119 for A, 0120 to 0124 for B, 0125 to 0129 for D;
ADR 0118 for the compute gateway (A) and ADR 0119 for the OIDC provider (B).
If a phase needs more, take the next unreserved number and say so in the PR.

**Outside gates** that no phase can pass on its own:
the Tapis tenant and the answers in the design's section 12 (the owner asks SDSC);
Worker secrets, the two Cloudflare R2 buckets with their lock and lifecycle rules, and the R2 API token (the owner creates them);
UC San Diego counsel's approval of the policies and the official-request procedure (Epic D, phase 5);
registering compute.nemar.org as an OIDC client (the owner, after Epic B merges).
Everything else is built and tested against local stand-ins first.

## 2. Roles and models

| Role | Model | Does | Never does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Driver | Haiku, maximum effort | Picks the next phase, briefs agents, runs the gates, drives review to convergence, merges phase PRs into epic branches, merges docs PRs that keep the design page current, keeps issues and state files current, escalates | Writes or edits code; merges an epic into an integration branch (nemar-cli `dev`, website `staging`, nemar-process `main`) without the owner's approval; sets secrets; decides a design question |
| Planner | Sonnet (Opus where the issue says) | Writes the phase plan as an issue comment for an `expand` phase | Implements |
| Implementer | as the issue's Routing says (Sonnet by default; Opus for B3, B4, D4) | Implements the phase in its worktree, tests first, opens the PR, fixes review findings on the same branch | Changes scope; merges |
| Reviewer | Sonnet panel through the project plugin's `pr-review-toolkit` | One full review round, a delta round only if round 1 was substantial | Fixes code |
| Advisor | Opus | Answers security, concurrency, authorization, data-integrity or architecture findings before they are fixed; runs the Opus checkpoint the issue names | Implements |

## 3. The driver's loop for one phase

1. **Pick.** Take the lowest-numbered phase whose `Depends on` phases are merged into its epic branch.
   Run at most three phases at once across all epics, never two phases that touch the same files.
2. **Read** the whole phase issue and the design sections it cites.
3. **Plan, if the issue says `expand`.** Brief the planner with the issue and ask for a plan comment that settles every "decide in plan" item, lists files, tests and gates, and stays inside the issue's scope.
   Check the plan against the acceptance criteria.
   If the plan would change a decision recorded in the design, an ADR or another issue, stop and escalate (section 5).
4. **Branch.** Create the phase worktree from the epic branch:
   `git -C <primary checkout> worktree add <worktrees dir>/<epic-slug>-<phase> -b feature/issue-<N>-<phase-slug> origin/<epic branch>`.
   Never edit the primary checkout.
5. **Delegate** with the brief in section 4, verbatim, to the model the issue names.
6. **Verify.** When the implementer reports, run the issue's Gates yourself in the worktree.
   A report is not a result; a gate you did not run did not pass.
7. **Review.** Run the project plugin's `pr-review-toolkit` on the PR with Sonnet reviewers.
   Every finding is fixed (no debt carried forward) except a false positive or a deliberate design choice, each answered with a one-line reason on the PR.
   Send security, concurrency, authorization, data-integrity and architecture findings to the Opus advisor before the implementer fixes them.
   Fixes go on the phase branch through the same implementer (continue it with SendMessage).
   At most two review rounds; if round two still finds something substantial, escalate.
8. **Opus checkpoint**, when the issue's Routing names one: brief the advisor with the PR and the issue's checkpoint text; fix what it finds the same way.
9. **Merge** the phase PR into the epic branch: `gh pr merge <PR> --squash --admin` once the gates pass and the review converged.
   The full CI run is the epic -> `dev` gate, not the phase gate.
10. **Record.** Tick the phase in the epic issue, close the phase issue, update the epic's state file (`.claude/epic-<slug>.local.md` in the primary checkout), and do the issue's "When merged" step:
    if the phase settled or changed anything the design page says, open a docs PR that updates `admin/design/compute-gateway` (or the runbook named) and merge it after its CI passes.
11. **Clean up.** Confirm the branch is merged and the worktree is clean, then `rm -rf` the worktree, `git worktree prune`, and delete the local branch (`git worktree remove` fails in this setup).

**Finishing an epic.**
Run the epic issue's definition of done end to end on a local backend (and the local website where it applies), and record the commands and results in the epic -> `dev` PR, which stays a draft until then.
Wait for the full CI run to be green, run one integration-scoped Sonnet review (cross-phase only), then ask the owner to approve the merge.
Merge with `--merge` (not squash) after approval.
Then check staging.

## 4. The implementer brief

Send this, filled in, as the whole prompt:

```text
You are implementing phase <key> of the NEMAR compute program: <issue URL>.
Read the issue in full (gh issue view <N> -R <repo>), then <repo>/AGENTS.md, .rules/testing.md, .rules/javascript.md (or the repository's equivalents), .context/compute-program/implementation-notes.md, and every ADR and design section the issue cites. The design page is in the nemarOrg/docs checkout at src/content/docs/admin/design/compute-gateway.md.

Work only in this worktree: <path>, branch <branch>, which tracks <epic branch>.
Write the issue's tests first and see them fail, then implement until they pass. Prove each test fails by mutating the line it guards.
Stay inside the issue's scope. If the issue is wrong or a decision is missing, stop and report it instead of deciding.
This repository is public: no tenant names, allocation ids, account names, host details, spend figures or real home paths anywhere.
Never mock NEMAR logic. Never hand-bump a version. Never set a secret or touch production.
Commit atomically with short messages (under 50 characters, no emojis, no AI or co-author attribution).
Run every command in the issue's Gates section and paste their final lines in your report.
Push and open a PR into <epic branch> titled "Phase <key>: <title>" whose body lists what changed, the gates you ran with results, and anything you could not do. GitHub bodies keep each paragraph on one line.
Report: the PR URL, the gates and their results, and every deviation from the issue.
```

## 5. When to stop and ask the owner

Escalate, with one message naming the issue, what is blocked, the options and a recommendation, when:

- a phase would change a decision in the design page, an ADR or another issue, or an ADR must be superseded;
- a security, privacy or data-integrity finding cannot be fixed inside the phase;
- something needs a secret, a credential, an account, a bucket or a bucket rule, an API token, a repository setting, a DNS record or a Tapis registration;
- something would reach outside: mail to real people, a post to SDSC or the tenant operator, a production deploy, turning on a switch, merging into `dev` or `main`;
- a gate still fails after two fix attempts and an advisor consultation;
- review round two still finds substantial problems;
- a phase takes more than twice the effort its size suggests;
- anything in the issue's "Escalate to the owner if" list happens.

Otherwise, proceed without asking.

## 6. Epics and phases

The issues are the source of truth for status and for each phase's brief; this table is the map.
Phase order within an epic is by key, except that A8 runs right after A5.

## 7. Rules that bind every phase

The full rules are `AGENTS.md`, `.rules/` and the ADRs; these are the ones this program trips over most.

- **Public repositories.** nemar-cli, nemar-process and website are public.
  Tenant names, allocation ids, account names, host details, spend figures and real home paths stay in the gated docs and in secrets.
- **No mocks of NEMAR logic.** Real D1, real routes, Miniflare R2 for the bucket bindings, `Bun.serve` stand-ins for Tapis, R2's S3 interface and ACCESS; say in a test when no real response could be recorded yet.
- **Fences.** New crons are production-only by default; switches (`COMPUTE_ENABLED`, `COMPUTE_PIPELINES_DISPATCH_ENABLED`) are absent from `backend/wrangler-sccn.toml` and pinned by tests; dev and production use separate Tapis credentials, because dev D1 shares real users.
- **Revocation cascades, always,** with the docblock caller counts updated.
- **Compute access is not upload access** (ADR 0040), and approval is a person's decision (ADR 0042).
- **Integer accounting** in thousandths of an SU; a refused hold writes nothing; the rate-limit counters are never a quota.
- **Nothing the job writes is trusted** for accounting or records.
- **Versions** are CI's (ADR 0016). **Worktrees** always. **Bun, Biome, uv, ruff, ty** only.
- **Merges:** phase into epic with `--squash --admin` after the gates; an epic into its integration branch (nemar-cli `dev`, website `staging`, nemar-process `main`) only after green CI and the owner's approval, never with `--admin`; a docs PR into nemarOrg/docs `main` after its CI passes, never with `--admin`.

## 8. Owner actions

- [ ] Send the design page to the SDSC colleague and collect answers to its section 12; ask for the dev and production tenants.
- [x] The four private Cloudflare R2 buckets exist (created 2026-11-04, location hint western North America; compute storage is R2, not AWS): `nemar-compute-records` and `nemar-compute-results` for production, `nemar-compute-records-dev` and `nemar-compute-results-dev` for dev. Records: bucket lock rules `records/` 2,557 days (7 years) and `logs/` 366 days in production, 1 day each in dev so tests can clean up; lifecycle rules deleting `incoming/` after 2 days and aborting incomplete multipart uploads after 1 day. Results: lifecycle rule deleting objects after 30 days and aborting incomplete multipart uploads after 1 day. Check them with `bunx cfman wrangler --account sccn -- r2 bucket lock list <bucket>` and `... r2 bucket lifecycle list <bucket>`.
- [ ] Create one R2 API token with Object Read & Write on the four compute buckets (the dashboard's R2 API tokens page; wrangler cannot make one) and store it in Infisical (project `nemar`, folder `/backend/compute`, environments `dev` and `prod`; the folder exists and already holds `COMPUTE_R2_S3_ENDPOINT`) as `COMPUTE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `COMPUTE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Then copy all three into the Worker secrets of production and dev, for example `infisical secrets get COMPUTE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID --env prod --path /backend/compute --plain --silent | tr -d '\n' | bunx cfman wrangler --account sccn secret put COMPUTE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID -c wrangler-sccn.toml` from `backend/` (add `--env dev` for dev). Later compute secrets (Tapis credentials, the ACCESS attributes key, `OIDC_SECRET`) go in the same folder. No AWS bucket or IAM user is needed for compute.
- [ ] Set the Tapis credentials as Worker secrets for dev and production once the tenant exists.
- [ ] Generate the ACCESS gateway attributes key for the community account and set it as the Worker secret `ACCESS_GATEWAY_ATTRIBUTES_KEY`, and set the name ACCESS knows the cluster by as `ACCESS_RESOURCE_NAME` (design question 14). Confirm the header that carries the key and the body's spelling against the real interface: both are unverified constants in `backend/src/services/access-attributes.ts`.
- [ ] Take the policies and the official-request procedure (Epic D, phase 5) to UC San Diego counsel.
- [ ] Register compute.nemar.org as an OIDC client after Epic B merges, and send its credentials to the SDSC colleague.
- [ ] Turn on `COMPUTE_ENABLED` and, later, `COMPUTE_PIPELINES_DISPATCH_ENABLED`, in production.

## 9. Starting the driver

Open Claude Code in the primary nemar-cli checkout with Haiku at maximum effort, and give it:

```text
You are the driver of the NEMAR compute program. Read .context/compute-program/README.md in full and follow it exactly; it is your operating manual. Then read the five epic issues it lists and the state files .claude/epic-*.local.md for these epics. Resume from the first phase that is not merged, following section 3 for every phase. Delegate all code to implementers per each issue's Routing, review with Sonnet through the project plugin's pr-review-toolkit, and escalate only on section 5's triggers. Report to me at each phase merge and whenever you escalate.
```
