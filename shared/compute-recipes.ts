/**
 * NEMAR's own processing recipes, as the compute gateway's pipeline dispatch knows them (epic #2005
 * phase A6, #2011; ADR 0118; design section 10). Pure and import-free, like `./compute-state.ts`, so
 * the Worker, the command-line interface and the tests read one table.
 *
 * WHAT A RECIPE ENTRY IS. The Worker's side of a recipe that lives in `nemarOrg/nemar-process`: its
 * name, the version and the engine the Worker EXPECTS it to report, the Tapis application that runs
 * it, the partition and resources one job asks for, and the files a finished run must have written.
 * The recipe's code, the images and the application definitions are that repository's. Every number
 * here is initial: the owner adjusts it with the pilot, and the application id and version follow
 * whatever `nemar-process` publishes. A test pins only that every entry is a valid job under
 * `JobSpecSchema` and inside the partition table.
 *
 * `version` AND `engine` ARE EXPECTATIONS, NOT FACTS. The stamp a run leaves (`compute_pipeline_stamps`)
 * is claimed with these values and, when the run succeeds, rewritten from the recipe's own record
 * (`readRecipeRecord`), so it says what actually ran. A recipe whose record disagrees with this table
 * is a registry out of date, and the daily dispatcher stops dispatching it until the table is fixed
 * (`registry_drift`).
 *
 * HOW A RECIPE IS RUN (nemar-process `docs/recipes.md`). The launcher runs an argument vector, so no
 * shell ever expands a variable: the paths below are absolute. The dataset is bound read-only at
 * `/data/<id>` and the job's outputs directory is `/work/outputs`. The launch specification's
 * environment allowlist is closed to six names and has none for an image digest, so the digest travels
 * as the ARGUMENT `--image-digest`. The recipe cannot check that value against the image it runs in; it
 * is the caller's claim, and the Worker compares it with the launcher's `provenance.json` before it
 * accepts a result (`recipeImageDigestArg`).
 *
 * TWO INPUTS, TWO EXECUTORS (portable compute, ADR 0121, plan D12). A recipe lists the `inputs` it reads:
 * `bids` (the dataset the launcher stages and binds read-only, the arguments above) or `zarr` (nothing
 * staged: the recipe streams the dataset's Zarr serving copy from `--zarr-base`, the one origin it may open,
 * and the Worker passes the commit that copy was built from, the version's tag commit and how they are
 * equivalent as `--source-commit`, `--tag-commit`, `--commit-equivalence` and `--commit-delta-path`;
 * `recipeZarrArguments`). The input is chosen in the COMMAND (`nemar-recipe run nemar-floor --input zarr`,
 * `recipeCommand`), not in the arguments: a Zarr job's arguments are the fixed ones and the delta paths,
 * which fill the 64 a job may carry (`ZARR_SOURCE_MAX_DELTA_PATHS`), so a BIDS run, whose command and
 * arguments are what they always were, and a Zarr run differ only in the two words after the recipe's name.
 * `executors` lists where a recipe may be dispatched: `tapis` (an allocation, a hold) or `runner` (a
 * registered runner pulls it, no hold). A dispatch to an executor a recipe does not list is refused. ONE
 * recipe, ONE registry entry, both inputs: `nemar-floor` is `bids` on Tapis and `zarr` on a runner, and
 * {@link RECIPE_INPUT_EXECUTOR} says which input runs where. A dispatch names its input or takes the
 * executor's ({@link defaultInput}); an input the recipe does not list, or one the executor does not run, is
 * refused before anything is claimed ({@link recipeRunsInput}). The input is part of the stamp's claimed
 * tuple, so a `bids` and a `zarr` run of one dataset version coexist.
