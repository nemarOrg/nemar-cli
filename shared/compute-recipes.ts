/**
 * NEMAR's own processing recipes, as the compute gateway's pipeline dispatch knows them (epic #2005
 * phase A6, #2011; ADR 0118; design section 10). Pure and import-free, like `./compute-state.ts`, so
 * the Worker, the command-line interface and the tests read one table.
 *
 * WHAT A RECIPE ENTRY IS. The Worker's side of a recipe that lives in `nemarOrg/nemar-process`: its
 * name, the version and the engine the Worker EXPECTS it to report, the Tapis application that runs
 * it, the partition and resources one job asks for, and the files a finished run must have written.
 * The recipe's code, the images and the application definitions are that repository's. Every number
 * here is initial: the owner adjusts it with the pilot, and the application id and version follow
 * whatever `nemar-process` publishes. A test pins only that every entry is a valid job under
 * `JobSpecSchema` and inside the partition table.
 *
 * `version` AND `engine` ARE EXPECTATIONS, NOT FACTS. The stamp a run leaves (`compute_pipeline_stamps`)
 * is claimed with these values and, when the run succeeds, rewritten from the recipe's own record
 * (`readRecipeRecord`), so it says what actually ran. A recipe whose record disagrees with this table
 * is a registry out of date, and the daily dispatcher stops dispatching it until the table is fixed
 * (`registry_drift`).
 *
 * HOW A RECIPE IS RUN (nemar-process `docs/recipes.md`). The launcher runs an argument vector, so no
 * shell ever expands a variable: the paths below are absolute. The dataset is bound read-only at
 * `/data/<id>` and the job's outputs directory is `/work/outputs`. The launch specification's
 * environment allowlist is closed to six names and has none for an image digest, so the digest travels
 * as the ARGUMENT `--image-digest`. The recipe cannot check that value against the image it runs in; it
 * is the caller's claim, and the Worker compares it with the launcher's `provenance.json` before it
 * accepts a result (`recipeImageDigestArg`).
