/**
 * Contract for the docs admin gate (epic #1336 phase 0, issue #1338).
 *
 * `docs.nemar.org/admin/*` is gated by NEMAR's own ORCID-backed session, not
 * by Cloudflare Access, so `users.role` stays the single source of truth for
 * who is an admin (ADR 0056). Three parties share the literals below and none
 * of them can import each other's code: this backend, the website's authorize
 * page (`nemarOrg/website`), and a Cloudflare Pages Function in `nemarOrg/docs`.
 *
 * SO THIS FILE IS THE REFERENCE DECLARATION, NOT YET AN ENFORCED CONTRACT, and
 * the difference matters when reading a value here. `account-copy.ts` has a
 * drift test on each side plus a CI sparse checkout; this file has neither, and
 * neither other repo transcribes it — they spell their own copies. Epic #1336's
 * drift-guard phase owns closing that. Until it does, a value here can be
 * stale, and one already was: an earlier version named the cookie
 * `nemar_docs_session` while the deployed Pages Function set
 * `__Host-nemar_docs_session`, and nothing noticed because nothing in this
 * repository reads that constant at all.
 *
 * The flow, and which party does what:
 *
 *   1. docs Pages Function  - no docs cookie, so 302 to APP authorize path
 *   2. website (SSR)        - proves an admin session, POST /auth/docs/grant
 *   3. website              - 302 to the docs callback path with the code
 *   4. docs Pages Function  - POST /auth/docs/exchange, set the docs cookie
 *   5. docs Pages Function  - GET /auth/docs/verify on every later request
 *
 * The code is one-time and short-lived because it travels in a URL, where it
 * lands in history, logs and any `Referer` a page later sends. The session
 * value it buys never travels in a URL at all.

/** Cookie the docs host sets for itself, matching what the Pages Function
 *  actually sets (`nemarOrg/docs`, `functions/__docs-auth/callback.ts`).
 *
 *  A DIFFERENT name from the app's `nemar_session` on purpose: two host-scoped
 *  cookies with one name is a debugging trap, and the distinct name makes a
 *  mix-up visible in a request dump rather than silent.
 *
 *  The `__Host-` prefix is the part that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
 *  it makes host-only scope BROWSER-ENFORCED. A cookie so named is refused
 *  unless it is `Secure`, `Path=/` and carries no `Domain` attribute, so no
 *  sibling host can plant one and no misconfiguration can widen it to
 *  `.nemar.org` — which is the whole reason this credential is separate from
 *  the app session (ADR 0056). */
