/**
 * The responses of the compute routes that are NOT under `/admin` and that something other than the
 * command-line interface (CLI) reads (epic #2005 review, ADR 0118): a person's cancel and links, which the
 * website and Epic D consume, and the observer's answer. They were backend-local types, so a change to
 * one reached a consumer by surprise; the schemas below are the contract, and a backend test parses the
 * real route output against them.
 *
 * Like `./compute-admin.ts`, every schema is open: a released reader keeps working when the Worker adds a
 * key, so each object accepts and keeps one it does not know, and a word the Worker may grow is a
 * string here and not an enum (the words that exist today are listed beside the schema). This file
 * imports nothing from `./compute.ts` and never the strict policy schema.
 *
 * Wire names are snake_case throughout. The observer's answer used to carry `sacctRows` and
 * `settlementFailed`; the observer does not read the answer body (it reads the status and drops the
 * rest), and nothing else consumed those keys, so they are `sacct_rows` and `settlement_failed` now.
