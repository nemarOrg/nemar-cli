/**
 * The runner contract, protocol `nemar.runner.v1` (portable compute, decisions D1, D2, D4 and D6):
 * every word, prefix, header, number and request and response shape that a runner (`nemar-runner`
 * in `nemarOrg/nemar-process`, on a workstation or a cluster) and NEMAR's Worker exchange, declared
 * once. The words shared with the job model (executors, accounting classes, backends, the runner
 * refusals and `runner_lost`) are in `../compute-state.ts`; this file adds the protocol's own.
 *
 * THE JSON SCHEMA NEXT TO THIS FILE IS SHARED BYTE FOR BYTE with `nemarOrg/nemar-process`, where the
 * runner is written. The runner cannot import this file, so `compute-runner.schema.json` is the
 * contract both sides check against, and `test/compute-runner-contract.unit.test.ts` holds the two
 * to each other: its constants are read back against these, and a generated corpus is judged by both
 * Ajv and zod. Whichever repository merges first writes the file; the other copies it, never edits it.
 *
 * REQUESTS ARE CLOSED, RESPONSES ARE OPEN. A runner can poll for days and must survive the Worker
 * adding a key to an answer, so every response is `.passthrough()`; every request is `.strict()`,
 * because the Worker validates it as it arrives and a mistyped key is a bug to refuse (the refusal
 * is `invalid_body`). Like `./compute.ts` and `./compute-launch.ts`, this file is exempted by name in
 * `test/contract-schemas.test.ts`. Never parse a response with a strict schema, and never build a
 * response schema from a request one.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a clock, a database or a network.
