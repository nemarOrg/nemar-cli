/**
 * The compute gateway's contract (epic #2005 phase A1, #2006; ADR 0118): the job specification
 * every front door submits, the partition and rate tables that turn resources and time into
 * service units, the owner policy the gateway reads, and the shapes of the files the launcher
 * leaves on the node. Authored in zod, importing only zod and `../compute-state.js`, so the Worker,
 * the CLI and the tests read one declaration.
 *
 * MONEY IS INTEGER THOUSANDTHS OF AN EXPANSE SERVICE UNIT (SU). One SU is one core-hour with up to
 * 2 GB of memory per core, or one GPU-hour. Every `*Milli` figure and every `*_milli` column is
 * such an integer; nothing here is, or may become, a floating-point amount.
 *
 * THESE SCHEMAS ARE STRICT ON PURPOSE (`.strict()`, exempted by name in
 * `test/contract-schemas.test.ts`): a job specification, an owner policy and the launcher's files
 * are validated as they come in, or written by the Worker, and a mistyped key must be refused, not
 * stripped. NEVER PARSE A RESPONSE WITH THEM AND NEVER BUILD ONE FROM THEM (`.extend()`, `.pick()`,
 * `.partial()`): a released CLI or a running launcher would fail on a newer server's extra key.
 * A response schema is lenient and lives in its own file; `./compute-launch.ts` shows the two
 * responses the launcher reads, which are `.passthrough()`.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WAS MEASURED AGAINST THE TENANT YET. The rate table, the `debug` ceilings and the
 * preempt basis below are the design's, unconfirmed with SDSC (design section 12, question 5);
 * each is marked where it is declared and stays marked until the first charge is compared with
 * Expanse's own record.

 *
 * The output directory is `outputs`, which the launcher's layout fixes (`work/outputs/`). `matlab`
 * is a valid specification; a route refuses it as `runtime_unavailable` until it is licensed.
 *
 * How the code runs, which is the contract the launcher keeps (its texts are
 * {@link COMPUTE_ENTRY_DESCRIPTION}, {@link COMPUTE_COMMAND_DESCRIPTION} and
 * {@link COMPUTE_ARGS_DESCRIPTION}): `runtime: python` with an `entry` runs `python /code/<entry>`
 * followed by `args`; a `command` runs as given with `args` appended; `runtime: image` with an
 * `entry` is allowed and runs `/code/<entry>` directly, which needs the executable bit that the

 * runtime. A bundle archive's member names may carry a leading `./`; absolute names, `..`, links,
 * devices and FIFOs are refused by the launcher.
 *
 * A dataset's `include` patterns are matched against manifest paths relative to the dataset root
 * ({@link COMPUTE_INCLUDE_DESCRIPTION}): `**` followed by `/` matches zero or more directories; `**`
 * elsewhere matches any run of characters including `/`; `*` and `?` stay inside one path segment;
 * `[abc]`, `[a-c]` and `[!abc]` are classes; a character class never matches `/`, so like `*` and `?`
 * it stays inside one path segment, and a negated class `[!a]` matches any single character except
 * `a` and `/`; an unterminated `[` is a literal `[`; an empty class
 * `[]` and an inverted range such as `[z-a]` are refused (`includePatternProblem`, which this
 * schema applies, so the launcher's `bad_include` is exactly the set of patterns the dialect
 * refuses); matching is case-sensitive; there are no escapes; and a matcher must run in time linear
 * in the pattern length times the path length (no backtracking).
 * There is no cap on how many wildcards a pattern holds. A dataset's `version` is what a person
 * writes (`1.0.2`); the Worker writes the data-plane tag for the launch specification
 * (`dataTagForVersion`).
 *
 * A valid job specification always fits the 64 KiB launch specification (see
 * {@link LAUNCH_VARIABLE_BYTES_MAX}) and is well formed: every string that reaches a process is
 * well-formed UTF-16 (see {@link computeIsWellFormed}), each refused here, with the field named by
 * its path, rather than after the hold exists; the dataset version tag is the one launch rule
 * JobSpecSchema does not enforce: a version such as `1.0`, `abc`, `V1.0.2` or `2.0.0-rc.1` is valid
 * for a job and has no data-plane tag, so the Worker and the CLI must run `launchSpecFits` (and
 * refuse with `invalid_spec`, naming the field {@link datasetVersionWithoutTag} finds) BEFORE the
 * hold.
 *
 * Two digests are named apart. `spec_digest` is the JOB ROW's digest of this document: the SHA-256,
 * in lowercase hex, of the exact bytes of `records/<id>/spec.json` (set by phase A3). It is not a
 * launcher key. The launcher's own is `launch_spec_digest` in `provenance.json` (see

 * `decodeLaunchSpecEnv`) decodes to, hashed by the launcher BEFORE it parses it. It is never the digest
 * of the encoded value (A1c, #2043). It is the launcher's digest and phase A5 stores it on the job row.
 * It is not the job row's `spec_digest`, which is the digest of `records/<id>/spec.json` (see
