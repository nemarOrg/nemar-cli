/**
 * The data plane's two public documents: a dataset's version listing and a
 * version's file manifest (`data.nemar.org/<id>` and
 * `data.nemar.org/<id>/<version>/manifest.json`, also mounted at
 * `<api>/data/...`).
 *
 * These are read by the CLI's HTTP download path, which fetches bytes by the
 * `bytes_url` on every entry and decides what `--no-data` means from
 * `checksum_algorithm`. Both of those are field names, so a rename on the
 * backend turns into "downloaded 0 files" and a green success line rather than
 * an error -- the same silent-cast failure mode `request()` in
 * `src/lib/api/client.ts` takes a schema to prevent. Validating here makes the
 * drift loud on the client, and the backend's `PublicManifestEntry` in
 * `backend/src/services/data-router.ts` is the producer these must agree with.
 *
 * Passthrough on the entry object is deliberate: the backend may add fields,
 * and an additive change must not fail a download.

 * `checksum_algorithm` is `"git"` for a file tracked in plain git and an annex

 * metadata and git-annex carries data, so that field -- not the file extension,
 * which ADR 0031 says is unreliable in both directions -- is what separates the
 * two.
 *
 * `size` is required rather than optional on purpose. It is what the download
 * path compares the written byte count against, and what its resume decision
 * reads; an entry without one cannot be verified or resumed, so an absent size
 * must fail validation rather than flow through as `undefined` and poison a
 * byte total with `NaN`.
