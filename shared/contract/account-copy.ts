/**
 * Every user-facing sentence about account tiers, upload access, and missing
 * profile fields — in one place, so the CLI and the website say the same thing
 * (epic #1250 phase 8, #1268; nemarOrg/website#309, #310).
 *
 * **This file is the source of truth.** `nemarOrg/website`'s
 * `src/lib/account-copy.ts` is a transcription of it with the same keys and the
 * same strings, the arrangement `publication-block.ts` already has with
 * `publicationBlockReasonSchema`. The two repos share no package, so the values
 * are transcribed rather than imported, and there is a drift test on each side:
 * `test/account-copy-parity.test.ts` here and `test/account-copy-drift.test.ts`
 * there, both of which read the OTHER repo's module as text and compare it key
 * by key whenever both checkouts sit side by side (each skips, with a note,
 * when the other is absent). Changing a sentence here means changing it there
 * in the same breath.
 *
 * **Four rules this file has to keep, because both drift tests and the
 * mirroring depend on them:**
 *
 * 1. *Every value is a literal string.* No template literals, no
 *    concatenation, no interpolation from a constant — the drift tests read the
 *    other repo's file as TEXT (neither can import a module from outside its
 *    own dependency graph), so a computed value would be invisible to them.
 *    Where a sentence embeds a number that lives somewhere else
 *    ({@link ACCOUNT_COPY}`["upload_access.request.why_hint"]` and the 20-500
 *    char bounds), the literal is written out and `account-copy.test.ts`
 *    asserts it still agrees with {@link UPLOAD_ACCESS_WHY_MIN_CHARS} /
 *    {@link UPLOAD_ACCESS_WHY_MAX_CHARS}.
 * 2. *Placeholders are `{name}`, filled by {@link fillCopy}.* A sentence with a
 *    moving part is a template, not a function, so it stays comparable as a
 *    string. The whole placeholder vocabulary is `{label} {blocks} {web} {cli}
 *    {date}`, plus `{reason}` on the CLI-only keys below.
 * 3. *Keys are stable and dotted.* They are the mirroring contract; renaming
 *    one is a change on both sides.
 * 4. *A `cli.` prefix means the website ignores it.* The mirroring is
 *    deliberately asymmetric: the website has no surface for sandbox training
 *    or for a terminal heading, and its drift test reports such keys as a note
 *    rather than a failure. Everything WITHOUT that prefix is mirrored there
 *    and must not be changed unilaterally.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here:
 *
 * - **Refusal messages.** `checkUploadAccessRequest` (backend
 *   services/upload-access.ts) and `profileRefusal` build their own `message`,
 *   and both clients prefer the backend's sentence wherever it sent one. What
 *   this file renders is the `missing` LIST under such a refusal, which is the
 *   half the two surfaces have to agree on.
 * - **Anchors and hrefs.** Website routing, and the CLI has nothing to mirror
 *   them with; `website/src/lib/profile-gaps.ts` owns them.
 * - **Admin status vocabulary.** Those name lifecycle rows for an operator,
 *   not the account model for its owner.
