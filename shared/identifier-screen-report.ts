/**
 * The identifier screen's report: one shape, written by the workflow that screens a dataset at
 * publication time, validated by the Worker before it stores a byte, and read back by the admin
 * email, the status views and the approval gate.
 *
 * **A report carries no value.** It holds closed-set kinds, counts, field names the scanner draws
 * from a closed set, and a few fixed words. The parser is the enforcement: it accepts only keys it
 * knows, only kinds in {@link FINDING_KINDS}, only numbers that are non-negative integers, and
 * only strings that match a narrow pattern, so a workflow that was changed to print a header's
 * text into its report is refused at the door rather than stored, mailed and shown. The parser
 * throws a fixed-word {@link ReportError}; it never quotes the input.
 *
 * **Unknown is never healthy** (ADR 0053). {@link screenGate} maps every state to what the
 * publication may do next, and a screen that did not run, did not finish or did not report is its
 * own state with its own answer, never "clean" and never "no findings".
