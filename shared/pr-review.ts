/**
 * The dataset pull-request review's contract (ADR 0092): the report a review run posts, the
 * verdict derived from it, the check-run words shown to people, and the rule that stops
 * reviewing a contributor whose pull requests keep being rejected.
 *
 * One module, three readers. The workflow script builds a report with it, the Worker parses
 * what comes back with it before storing a byte, and the check-run is rendered from it, so
 * the check, the stored row and the tally cannot disagree about what a review said.
 *
 * **Every field of a pull request is attacker-controlled text**: title, body, commit messages,
 * file names, file contents. That text reaches a language model, and the model's output reaches
 * a public-facing check-run. Three rules keep the model from steering the outcome:
 *
 *  1. **The verdict is derived, never reported.** The model supplies a result per criterion and
 *     some findings. {@link verdictOf} decides pass, fail or uncertain from those and from
 *     facts the script computed from git, and no field of the report is "the verdict".
 *  2. **Facts override the model.** A criterion the git facts contradict cannot pass, whatever
 *     the model said ({@link factsOf}).
 *  3. **Free text is a note, never markup.** The one place a model's words reach a person,
 *     {@link sanitizeNote}, removes links, mentions, cross-references, HTML and emphasis, so a
 *     note cannot ping someone, link anywhere or hide the verdict.
 *
 * **Unknown is never green** (ADR 0053, ADR 0054, ADR 0086). Anything that is not a clear pass maps to a
 * conclusion that does not satisfy a required check: `neutral` and `skipped` DO satisfy one on
 * GitHub, which is why neither appears in {@link conclusionOf}.
 *
 * The parser throws a fixed-word {@link PrReviewReportError}; it never quotes its input.
