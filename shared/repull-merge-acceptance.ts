/**
 * A re-pull's squash merge made without its trailers, accepted on evidence (ADR 0111, the
 * amendment of 2026-10-29). Pure, and the one definition of each rule below:
 *  - the ledger's words and fixed values a re-pull writes (`LEDGER_REPO_PATH`,
 *    `SCRUB_LEDGER_ACTIONS`, `MERGE_ACCEPTED_ACTION`, `MERGE_ACCEPTED_VERIFICATION`,
 *    `REPULL_LEDGER_ACTOR`), which the ledger's validator (`scripts/scrub/ledger.ts`), the delta
 *    scrub, the Worker and the CLI import;
 *  - the acceptance line (`mergeAcceptanceLine`), built by the Worker and validated by the ledger;
 *  - what a commit did to the ledger (`ledgerChange`) and which commits a ledger's acceptance lines
 *    name (`acceptedMergesOf`), read by the fresh-clone proof (`scripts/scrub/git/git-lib.ts`), the
 *    Worker and the CLI;
 *  - enrichment's bound of commits (`ENRICHMENT_MAX_COMMITS`), read by the CLI's shape check
 *    (`src/lib/repull/execute/head.ts`) and the Worker.
 * Two readings stay apart on purpose, because they read different things: the Worker compares two
 * root trees from GitHub's answers (`sameOutsideNemar`) and reads "moved by enrichment only" from
 * GitHub's comparison, which names paths (`isEnrichmentPath`), while the CLI reads git objects in a
 * clone, compares every entry (`outsideNemar` in `release.ts`) and reads each enrichment commit's
 * content (`isEnrichment` in `execute/head.ts`). Both must agree for `resume` to go on.
 *
 * The merge gate writes the squash message so that its last paragraph is the re-pull commit's
 * trailers, because the privacy ledger's fresh-clone proof (ADR 0085) reads a commit that appends
 * a `repull-scrubbed` line beside other files as the re-pull's own only when it carries them. A
 * merge made outside the gate (GitHub's merge button) carries GitHub's message instead, and the
 * proof would fail the dataset for good. Rewriting `main` is not a repair: the tag, a minted DOI
 * and public clones name the commit.
 *
 * So the acceptance is evidence in the repository itself: one ledger line, written by NEMAR in a
 * commit of its own on `main` after the merge, that names the accepted merge commit by its full
 * id. The proof accepts a commit that appends a `repull-scrubbed` line without the trailers only
 * when a branch tip whose first-parent history holds it carries such a line naming exactly it; a
 * line that names anything but a re-pull's merge in such a history fails the proof on its own.
 * The line holds fixed words and two hex ids, never the administrator's reason, which is free text
 * and stays in NEMAR's database: the ledger refuses free text by design (ADR 0085, ADR 0036).
